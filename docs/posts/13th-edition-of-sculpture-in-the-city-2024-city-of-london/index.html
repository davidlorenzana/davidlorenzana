<p>Having lived in Sydney for 13 years Sculpture by the Sea (begins mid-October) was one of my favourite events of the year. The sculptures hug the coastline of beaches, clifftops, and gardens from Bondi to Tamarama with an eclectic variety of people (500,00 visitors over two weeks) getting the opportunity to see sculptures when they would not necessarily seek it out.  From local residents, to joggers, surfers and people who actually made the effort to come for what is a spectacular annual event where sculptures are set against mother nature’s natural beauty.</p>
<p>Sculpture in the City does the same but in the man-made environment of London’s urban and dynamic Square Mile filled with striking modern architecture like Richard Rogers’ Lloyds Building, The Gherkin (30 St Mary Axe Tower), The Cheese Grater (The Leadenhall Building) and continues to be ever evolving. A new selection of artworks by internationally acclaimed and emerging artists have been unveiled comprising 17 artworks of which 10 are sculpture. This has grown from the 4 art works originally displayed in 2011. The city will now have a vibrant open-air gallery. It is a complex project in many ways which comes from the 423 submissions offered from which a shortlist is made, and sites need to be secured and placement considered for each. With the continual development in the city locations for display change year on year.</p>
<p>The art displays unexpected pops of colour where you least expect it, bringing the area to life as well as more subtle pieces such as humourous dedication plaques on benches by Oliver Bragg. <em>“In loving memory of Stuart Spittle, who spouted preposterous piffle”, “In loving memory of a loving memory”</em></p>

<p><em>The Kissing Gate</em> by Maya Rose Edward situated in Aldgate Square, brings a rural gate into the urban landscape in the hope of prompting romantic encounters between passers-by. A charming concept in a part of London that is ordinarily all business. For the city slickers and other who may not be in the know, a kissing gate is a gate allowing one person at a time but not livestock to pass through. Thought to get its name from the idea that a man out walking with a woman could hold the gate firmly shut, demanding a kiss as payment before permitting her to pass through. For some it becomes a tradition for couples to kiss each time they pass through a kissing gate. Maya explains her attraction to its concept being that structurally they never just open and they never close in the way that normal doors and gates operate, there is no right of way, and movement is in both directions without ever having to close it behind you or hence metaphorically never having to leave pieces of yourself behind. <em>The Kissing Gate</em> is displayed on a platform which may make people think it is not to be touched but the artist whole heartedly hopes and encourages people to pass through it.</p>

<p>At 120 Fenchurch Street is Seph Li’s mesmeric digital piece <em>Everything Before Everything After</em> which provides a medative moment in what is otherwise a thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Another sculpture of note is <em>Secret Sentinels</em> crafted from found objects and covered in mosaic tiles at 70 St Mary Axe by Clare Burnett. The sculpture references the ubiquitous cameras in the City’s security systems (of which several are visible when viewing this piece), exploring the balance between privacy and surveillance.</p>
<p>Four more works will be unveiled in September and will form part of London Sculpture Week from 21-29 September 2024.</p>

<p>With children on holiday now I see this as a perfect free activity for them by creating a self-guided sculpture hunt around the city. Some sculptures are tucked away and are worth seeking out and the best way to do this is by downloading the Bloomberg Connects free arts and culture app which provides a map of locations and further explanation of each artwork. In addition, for families, look out for The Family Trail on the app which has an audio guide with Martha Howe-Douglas of Horrible Histories.</p>
<p>The exhibition is also accompanied by an Activation Programme with bookable free events such as <a href="https://www.sculptureinthecity.org.uk/little-art-critics-tv/">Little Art Critics TV</a> where children between 5-12 years try their hand at being a TV art critic taking the microphone and giving their unfiltered reactions to Sculpture in the City artworks live on camera, which is then publicly screened, and each participant receives an email with a link to the completed TV show.</p>
<p>Overall Sculpture in the City provides a wonderful addition to a summer in London filled with free events to entertain and stimulate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Date:</strong></em> <em>24 July 2024 — Spring 2025.</em> <em><strong>Location:</strong></em> <em>City of London’s financial district. Sculpture in the City is completely free and accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</em> <a href="https://www.sculptureinthecity.org.uk/"><em>sculptureinthecity.org.uk</em></a>.</p>
