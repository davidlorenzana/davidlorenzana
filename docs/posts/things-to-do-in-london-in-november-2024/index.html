<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> Eva Recacha’s new work, <em>The Picnic,</em> will be presented at the Lilian Baylis Studio from 27 -29 November. This performance celebrates themes of togetherness and joy through movement and design, inspired by Hieronymus Bosch’s <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em>. Initially created during a period of social upheaval, the piece now conveys a self-celebratory tone while exploring utopian ideals. The performance features a unique soundscape by Alberto Ruiz Soler and is co-commissioned by Sadler’s Wells and South East Dance.</p>
