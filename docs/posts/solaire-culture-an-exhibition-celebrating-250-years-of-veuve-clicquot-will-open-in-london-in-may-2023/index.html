<p><em>SOLAIRE CULTURE</em> celebrates Veuve Clicquot&rsquo;s 250 years of history, focusing on the legacy of Madame Clicquot, one of the world&rsquo;s first female entrepreneurs who took over the reins of the house in 1805, and the contemporary vision of the curator, Camille Morineau, and designer Constance Guisset. The exhibition also features Veuve Clicquot&rsquo;s cultural footprint and showcases the creation of its iconic Yellow label, which was created specifically for the British Champagne drinker. The exhibition features renowned female artists, including Yayoi Kusama, Cece Philips, Rosie McGuinness, Sheila Hicks, and Moyoco Anno, who have created original artworks inspired by Madame Clicquot and the power of the sun, paying tribute to the House&rsquo;s yellow label, and showcasing the bold and optimistic nature of the modern-day champagne house through an immersive journey.</p>

<p>Veuve Clicquot has been committed to supporting women entrepreneurs through its BOLD program since 1972. The exhibition includes a new BOLD room, and a dynamic program of cultural events is also available. The exhibition also features The Sunny Side Up Café, curated with Andi Oliver, offering a menu inspired by Veuve Clicquot&rsquo;s Yellow Label and Caribbean flavours.</p>

<p>The cafe&rsquo;s menu was curated in collaboration with Andi Oliver and draws inspiration from Veuve Clicquot&rsquo;s Yellow Label and Caribbean flavours.
