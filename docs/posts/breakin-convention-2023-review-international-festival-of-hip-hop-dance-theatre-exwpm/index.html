<p>We had the pleasure of attending the 20th-anniversary celebration of the renowned international hip-hop dance festival, Breakin&rsquo; Convention, at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells on Saturday evening. The show began with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonzid/?hl=en">Jonzi D</a>, the festival&rsquo;s founder, taking the stage to reflect on the event&rsquo;s history. As a first-time attendee of Breakin&rsquo; Convention, it was a welcomed trip down memory lane. It was fascinating to hear about the festival&rsquo;s progress over the last decade, which included remarkable achievements like performing at Apollo Theater, Harlem and culminating with the 2023 Breakin&rsquo; Convention and the creation of the first hip-hop theatre school, the <a href="https://www.breakinconvention.com/hip-hop-theatre-academy">Breakin&rsquo; Convention Academy.</a></p>
<p>The festival lasted the entire weekend and featured an impressive range of family-friendly activities both on and off stage. The performances from both local and global talent featured jaw-dropping displays of poppers, lockers, beatboxers, and graffiti artists. The live music performances added another layer of excitement to the already lively event. It was a beautiful community gathering that brought together people of all ages and backgrounds to celebrate the transformative power of hip-hop culture.</p>

<p>The show featured a range of performers from old school dancers to new faces, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ladivapiedsnus/?hl=en-gb">La Diva aux Pieds Nus</a> (The Barefoot Divas), an all-female French crew who celebrated women&rsquo;s individuality and plurality through their mesmerising performance. Their dance combined Afro-Caribbean, Latino, and traditional African forms and conveyed what felt like the beauty and struggle of being a woman, including a tribute to Maya Angelou&rsquo;s Phenomenal Woman, highlighting the power and excellence of womanhood. The music complemented the emotions expressed. The international dance crew <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ill_abilities/">ILL-Abilities,</a> featuring the extraordinary talents of Samuel Henrique &ldquo;Samuka&rdquo; da Silveira Lima and Redouan &ldquo;Redo&rdquo; Ait Chitt, delivered a performance that stole the show. Despite their disabilities, they showed a stunning display of talent and skill, with Samuel&rsquo;s incredible breakdance moves and flips with just one leg leaving the audience in a standing ovation. The crew&rsquo;s name, &lsquo;ILL-Abilities&rsquo;, turns the negative connotation of disability into a positive one, promoting a message of resilience.</p>

<p>The festival showcased a diverse range of performances, each with their own unique flavour. The South Korean dance crew MOVERs brought incredible acrobatics and humour to the stage, while <a href="https://www.instagram.com/threadingtheater/">Threading Theater&rsquo;s</a> soothing performance left the audience in silence. The interlocking movements of the three dancers appeared simple at first, but as the performance progressed, the complexity of their artistry became apparent.</p>
<p><a href="in-conversation-with-ruben-chi-amp-roche-apinsa-of-ghetto-funk-collective.html">Ghetto Funk Collective</a> brought an incredible feel-good performance to the stage, making it impossible for anyone to resist bopping their heads to the funky rhythm. Their dynamic show blended a unique fusion of funky moves, soulful saxophone playing, and groovy 70s style.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/boyblueent/">Boy Blue</a>, a dance crew of all ages and body types, entered the stage to huge cheers from the crowd and delivered an intense and confident display of group movement. Founded in London in 2001 by choreographer Kenrick “H20” Sandy and composer Michael “Mikey J” Asante, Boy Blue have built a powerhouse brand, blending hip-hop dance with striking visuals and a sense of theatre. They have a long history of delivering incredible performances, including contributing to the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics. It was clear that Boy Blue is as much about community as it is about dance, and as one member of the crew said when asked what Boy Blue was- <em>‘Boy Blue is life’</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/officiallestwins/">Les Twins</a>, the dynamic dance duo consisting of Larry and Laurent Bourgeois, along with their crew Criminalz, delivered as the headliners of the festival. Their body-popping performance left the audience gasping and cheering from start to finish. Les Twins have been making waves in the dance industry having toured with the likes of Beyoncé for over a decade, won prestigious dance competitions, starred in movies, and embarked on their own successful tours. Their electrifying performance was the perfect way to end an inspiring evening of dance.</p>

<p>During the show, Jonzi D received recognition from the State Assembly of New York for his invaluable contributions to promoting hip-hop in the UK. The prestigious award was presented by none other than the Legendary Twins, Keith and Kevin Smith. This acknowledgment was a clear testament to the festival&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to celebrating diversity and bringing people from all walks of life together through the power of dance. From young kids dancing alongside their parents during the interval to teenagers absorbed in live music performances in the foyer, and a mix of young and older adults enjoying the show together, the festival demonstrated its ability to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. <em><strong>Date:</strong></em> <em>Friday 28 April – Sunday 30 April 2023.</em> <em><strong>Location:</strong></em> <em>Sadler’s Wells Theatre and Lilian Baylis Studio, Rosebery Ave, London EC1R 4TN.</em></p>
