<p><strong>Earth by Deepa Mehta</strong></p>
<p>This film, directed by Deepa Mehta, is part of the London Indian Film Festival. Set during the violent partition of India in 1947, it tells a gripping story of politics, love, and revenge. Through the perspective of Lenny, a young girl affected by polio, the film explores the deep divisions that tear apart her country. As tensions escalate and violence spreads, Lenny&rsquo;s nanny, Shanta, becomes caught between two men, Hasan and Dil Navaz, while trying to ensure Lenny&rsquo;s safety. The impending partition brings devastation to communities, and Shanta&rsquo;s life is thrown into turmoil. This extraordinary film delves into the impact of historical events on personal lives.</p>

<p><strong>In conversation with Haley Josephs</strong></p>

<p>Image: Portrait of Haley Josephs in her studio  © Haley Josephs</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from notions of transformation, mortality, and femininity, Haley Josephs paints solitary figures in fantastical yet foreboding environments that transcend time and space. A recurring character within Josephs&rsquo; work is the artist&rsquo;s late sister, who is often evoked in bold, almost daring, portraits that amalgamate intimate and personal narratives of the artist with the universal human condition. New York-based Josephs&rsquo; paintings have been exhibited internationally, including at the Cleveland Institute of Art. Her work is in the collection of the X Museum, Beijing. <em><strong>Click</strong></em> <a href="in-conversation-with-haley-josephs.html"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a> <em><strong>to read the full interview.</strong></em></p>
