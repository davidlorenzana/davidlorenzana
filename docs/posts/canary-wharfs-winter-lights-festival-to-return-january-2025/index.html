<p>Canary Wharf’s Winter Lights festival returns this January for its ninth edition, bringing with it a blend of light-based art installations from both renowned and emerging artists worldwide. The free, annual event has become a much-anticipated fixture for Londoners and visitors alike, as the neighbourhood is transformed into a vibrant, luminous wonderland. This year’s showcase includes 11 newly commissioned installations as well as popular permanent pieces.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c9534c4af4683461d462c6b/967e568c-6055-41ac-8776-b1ea0e20b339/IMG_1365.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Portal Lucid Creates</p>
<p>Among the highlights for 2025 are installations that blend realism with fantasy, including a stack of illuminated bathtubs created by Benedikt Tolar, which pulses with light and sound. At Cabot Square, Atelier Sisu’s <em>Evanescent Droplets</em> transforms the fountain into a mesmerising sparkling pool, while a UK-first display of a luminous bird in flight by Luminariste brings an ethereal energy to the space. Lucid Creates will present a larger-than-life light portal in Wood Wharf, inviting attendees into an almost otherworldly landscape that reflects the festival’s blend of immersive, experiential art.</p>
<p>The installations are open to explore nightly from 5 to 10 pm. For easy navigation, the Winter Lights map is available on Canary Wharf’s app.</p>
<p><em><strong>Date:</strong></em> <em>21 January - 1 February 2025.</em> <em><strong>Location:</strong></em> <em>Canary Wharf.</em> <em><strong>Price:</strong></em> <em>Free.</em> <a href="https://canarywharf.com/whats-on/winter-lights-2025/"><em><strong>canarywharf.com</strong></em></a></p>
