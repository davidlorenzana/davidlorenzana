<p>We had the privilege of attending a one-night-only event, &ldquo;An Evening with Edward Enninful” held at the Southbank Centre. The fashion editor, who appeared in conversation with the screenwriter Michaela Coel to mark the publication of his memoir <em>A Visible Man</em>, wore a black three-piece suit, white shirt, and his trademark thick-rimmed glasses. “I don’t have very good eyesight,” he joked, “but I have vision.”</p>
<p>The evening started with a short film and speech by Edward&rsquo;s nearest and dearest expressing their gratitude for Edward and his achievements in his memoir. His memoir highlights some prominent events that take place within his career that touch on race and classism which Edward references throughout the interview.</p>
<p>Edward is cheerful and witty as they dive straight into his hometown Ghana, Accra. We were given fascinating insights into the experiences of a dreamy, imaginative boy growing up on an army base in Accra under the stern eye of his father, a major in the Ghanaian army. Enninful’s mother, a talented dressmaker, is the comforting parent. He credits time spent in her studio and visits to measure clients for new gowns with teaching him how to talk to women about style and how to empower them to experiment.</p>
<p>Many influences shaped his youthful creativity, including the diversity of the late 80s/early 90s, Ladbroke Grove and beyond. Kensington Market, Boy George, Whitney Houston and “Buffalo” style sparked up his imagination. It is during this period, whilst on the tube, stylist Simon Foxton spots the teenage Enninful, scouting him for a modelling job.</p>
<p>He soon shows unusual promise, not just as a model but as an adventurous stylist too. That promise is realised just a few years later when he’s offered a job as fashion director of the era-defining i-D magazine. Aged 18, he was the youngest person ever to hold that position. Michela and his mother grew up in the same village. The link and bond between the two was harmonious, as they chat like two friends catching up.</p>
<p>Enninful’s rise through the fashion industry, from i-D to styling at Calvin Klein and Dolce &amp; Gabbana to working at American Vogue and being awarded an OBE – dominate the book. But though there are plenty of tales of jet-setting, and glamour, the autobiography shows its worth when Enninful makes himself vulnerable. While this is broadly a triumphalist account of enormous success, it is also the record of a man who has lurched between periods of great difficulty. He dives into dark times, talking about having eyesight problems, sickle cell trait, and his mother&rsquo;s passing.</p>
<p>Turning 50 just last year, he expressed how much energy he has since his milestone birthday. He recently got married to his long-term partner Alec of 20 years and ultimately, he is just getting started and has so much more to give to the world.</p>
<p>He left the crowd feeling encouraged, inspiring a whole new generation. He shows us anything is possible when you work hard with passion and believe in your vision and gifts. A standing ovation from the crowd sealed the night, cheering for a man who is adored for believing in his vision and standing in his blackness.</p>
