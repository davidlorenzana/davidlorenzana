<p>**#FLODown:**The Barbican’s art gallery, The Curve, presents the works of Nigerian-American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola. Odutola explores an imagined ancient myth, with an immersive accompanying soundscape by artist Peter Adjaye. Odutola plays with the notion that drawing can be a form of storytelling, and challenges viewers to piece together fragments of the stories she presents. Working exclusively with materials such as pastels and charcoal, Odutola takes inspiration from ancient history, popular culture and contemporary politics.</p>
<p>The exhibition has now been extended to 24th January 2021.</p>
