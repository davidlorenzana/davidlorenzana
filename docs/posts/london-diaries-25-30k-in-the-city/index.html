<h1 id="monday"><strong>Monday</strong></h1>
<p>Due to the pandemic, I’ve been working from home since March which has been a great opportunity to get extensive wear out of my pyjamas and gym gear. I logged into my work emails after a two-week break to find 80 emails – a daunting start to a Monday. Thankfully, I get CCed into a lot of emails so a lot of it wasn’t relevant anymore.</p>
<p>I work as a Copywriter which is a really busy and varied role. I get to work with lots of different brands to create, edit and proof copy ranging from medical to fashion schools. I feel really privileged to be able to do what I love for a living: write. However, the job can be stressful, particularly as we’re a small team so if one of us is away, it can make a big difference.</p>
<p>I hope in the future I might be able to write for a newspaper or magazine and have a bit more creative control over what I write. In the meantime, I try to pick up a bit of freelance work to boost my income and to give me experience of writing for different brands and companies.</p>
<p><strong>Total spend:</strong> £0.</p>
<h1 id="tuesday"><strong>Tuesday</strong></h1>
<p>The day kicked off a bit later than intended – working from home means you can wake up 10 minutes before you’re due to be online. At lunch, I completed an online workout so that after work I could focus on sorting out my bedroom, ready for my mum to paint.</p>
<p>As per usual, I ended up ordering several books from Waterstones costing around £28 (free delivery though!). Despite having about 30 unread books in my room, I can’t stop buying.</p>
<p><strong>Total spend:</strong> £28.</p>
<h1 id="wednesday"><strong>Wednesday</strong></h1>
<p>After a day of work, I ended up meeting a friend for a drink in one of Sutton’s many local bars (think more Wetherspoons, rather than The Ned).</p>
<p>While living in London, I really enjoyed the freedom of being able to have dinner or drinks in the city. I rented a room in Waterloo which was so small that dinner guests had to sit on the bed to eat. Since the lockdown, I’ve been living at home with a view to hopefully putting a deposit down somewhere in the next couple of years (probably not inside any Zone though given my income vs. house prices).</p>
<p>Before the lockdown, <a href="https://www.bar-elba.co.uk/">Bar Elba</a> in Waterloo was one of my favourite haunts; it was great for me when I was dating because it was only a stone’s throw from my house so if things weren’t going well, I had an easy escape!</p>
<p><strong>Total spend:</strong> £15.</p>
<h1 id="thursday"><strong>Thursday</strong></h1>
<p>Decided to brave an early morning gym session which means sleepwalking into town and getting onto the stepper for 20 minutes before hitting the weights. I used this as an opportunity to start my working day in my local Café Nero (which was great until a child screamed during my weekly catch-up with my manager). Usually, when I’m in the office, I nip out with a colleague at around 11am to pick up my daily coffee from <a href="https://prufrockcoffee.com/">Prufrock Coffee</a> in Holborn, but chain coffee will have to suffice for now!</p>
<p><strong>Total spent:</strong> £3.</p>
<h1 id="friday"><strong>Friday</strong></h1>
<p>Friday’s are always big days at work – we have to get company-wide comms out by 4pm which can often be a bit stressful but at least you feel a sense of achievement when you log off!</p>
<p>After a long week, I headed to Clapham to meet two schools friends at <a href="https://www.thesugarcane.co.uk/">Sugar Cane</a> to enjoy their happy hour (£5 cocktails!) and dinner. We then nipped next door to <a href="https://www.barsocial.co.uk/">Bar Social</a>; I think by 11pm that evening I was about 70% rum. I would usually avoid my bank balance for a few days but seeing as I agreed to keep a diary of my expenditure, I can say that the total spend that evening was close to £80.</p>
<p><strong>Total spend:</strong> £90.</p>
<h1 id="saturday"><strong>Saturday</strong></h1>
<p>Saturday mornings are dedicated to spin classes – I’m not sure anyone actually enjoys them, but you feel great after! After that, I went to meet a university friend for dinner in London at one of our favourite vegetarian restaurants, <a href="https://www.mildreds.co.uk/soho/">Mildreds</a>, and have our quarterly catch-up about the latest books we’ve been reading. We wolfed down their Grilled Roman Artichoke and Gyoza Dumpling starters. I then enjoyed the tasty Levant Chick’n Kebabs – a guilt-free (minus the money I spent when I should be saving and the glass of wine afterwards) meal.</p>
<p><strong>Total spent on food and drinks:</strong> £54.</p>
<h1 id="sunday"><strong>Sunday</strong></h1>
<p>I try to have one day at the weekend completely free to pursue my own projects and get some errands done before the week ahead. After a long walk and a coffee in town (and potentially the purchase of a new jumper from H&amp;M – but that’s between me and HSBC), I spent the afternoon writing for a freelance project and reading my book.</p>
<p><strong>Total spend:</strong> £22.99.</p>
