<p>This week&rsquo;s featured cause is none other than The Big Help Out, due to occur on May 8, 2023. This uplifting event will invite members of the public to partake in volunteering and providing support to their local communities. Spearheaded by <a href="https://together.org.uk">The Together Coalition</a>, along with partners like The Scouts and the Royal Voluntary Service, The Big Help Out seeks to bring into focus the remarkable impact of volunteering on communities, forging an enduring legacy of volunteering from the Coronation Weekend.</p>
