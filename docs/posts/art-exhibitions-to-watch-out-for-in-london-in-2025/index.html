<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> This spring, Tate Modern will celebrate the provocative career of Leigh Bowery (1961-1994), an artist known for his boundary-pushing work across fashion, performance, and art. The exhibition <em>Leigh Bowery!</em> will showcase his outlandish costumes, paintings, photography, and videos, highlighting his influence on art, fashion, and popular culture. Bowery’s journey from a young boy in Melbourne to a globally recognized cultural figure will be explored, with a focus on his impact on London’s nightlife and the launch of his iconic club night Taboo in 1985. The exhibition will also feature collaborations with figures like Lucian Freud, as well as his performance art, such as the ‘mirror’ performance and his infamous ‘birth’ performances. Bowery’s creativity extended to music with his band Minty, and his final performance in 1994 marked the far-reaching influence he had on art and fashion.</p>

<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> This exhibition will showcase South Asian artists connected to Indian sculptor Mrinalini Mukherjee, featuring works by her peers, teachers, and her own 40-year career. Artists include her parents, Benode Behari and Leela Mukherjee, modernist pioneers like KG Subramanyan, and prominent figures such as Nilima Sheikh and Jagdish Swaminathan. Mukherjee’s intricate art merges abstraction with the human form, influenced by nature, South Asian traditions, and international modernist design. Organised by the Royal Academy of Arts and The Hepworth Wakefield, a major retrospective of Mukherjee will also be held at The Hepworth Wakefield in 2026.</p>

<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> In April 2025, Giuseppe Penone will have a major retrospective at Serpentine South Gallery, showcasing works from 1977 to the present. As a key figure in the Arte Povera movement, Penone’s sculptures and drawings use materials like wood, bronze, and wax to explore the deep connection between humanity and the natural world. Set in the surroundings of Kensington Gardens, the exhibition highlights nature’s vitality and its powerful presence in art, offering a reflective space on ecology and our relationship with the environment.</p>

<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> In 2025, Mickalene Thomas’s <em>All About Love</em> exhibition will tour major institutions in the US and UK. The tour starts at The Broad in Los Angeles, moves to the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and concludes at the Hayward Gallery at the Southbank Centre. Thomas’s art redefines beauty, sexuality, and identity, drawing inspiration from 19th-century painting, pop culture, and Black feminist theory. Her work challenges portraiture conventions and explores Black and female identity within art history, embodying themes of love, empowerment, and joy.</p>

<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> In summer 2025, Dulwich Picture Gallery will present Rachel Jones’ first solo contemporary exhibition, featuring new works that explore identity and the inner self. Jones, whose previous exhibitions include the Museum of African Diaspora (2024) and Chisenhale Gallery (2022), will create pieces that engage with the Gallery’s collection. Known for her use of abstraction, colour, and mixed media, Jones employs layers of oil stick and pastel to express emotions through texture and form. Motifs of mouths, symbolising both a literal and metaphorical connection to the inner self, frequently appear in her work.</p>
