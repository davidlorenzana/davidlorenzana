Leaving the tram at Beckenham Junction, you’d have been hard pressed to believe there was anything significant going on in the town on Saturday as dog walkers and brunchers milled about, basking in the glorious summer weather. However, just a short walk away, Beckenham Place Park welcomed a sea of bucket hats and became home to one of the most recognisable festival in Drum &amp; Bass for the day.">

<p>Leaving the tram at Beckenham Junction, you’d have been hard pressed to believe there was anything significant going on in the town on Saturday as dog walkers and brunchers milled about, basking in the glorious summer weather. However, just a short walk away, Beckenham Place Park welcomed a sea of bucket hats and became home to one of the most recognisable festival in Drum &amp; Bass for the day.</p>
<p>To the delight of D&amp;B lovers, Hospitality in the Woods returned for the first time since 2021, welcoming some of Hospital Records most recognisable names. Launched in 2016, Hospitality in the Woods has attracted visitors from across the globe year-on-year who come together to celebrate one of the most energetic and iconic genres of music.</p>
<p>Across the day, ravers hit the stages to enjoy the music in the blistering sunshine, clad in festival attire and ready to let loose for an unparalleled day of D&amp;B. However, tucked away in a deeper part of the park, an almost secret D&amp;B rave was going on. Entry was closely monitored and if you were too quick, you’d have missed it. Hidden in a raft of trees was the 30 years of V stage, which welcomed some old school ravers DJ Marky and Roni Size. Both DJs created an electric atmosphere in what felt like a strangely intimate setting.</p>

<p>While all the stage and tents were packed out, many gathered on the park’s hilltop, nostalgic of the iconic one at Glastonbury that dons the festival’s name, except this time, the Hospitality name stood proud. Ravers danced to their favourite tracks and soaked up the atmosphere, armed with beaten down trainers, brought out especially for occasions such as this.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the festival welcomed arguably one of D&amp;B’s most exciting up and coming musical acts in Pola and Bryson, a duo who have stormed onto the scene, as part of the Shogun Audio Showcase. If you haven’t already, check out their remix of ‘Us’ by Alchemist. Big names such as Etherwood, Flava D and Fred V got the crowd moving, ready for a number of exciting headliners.</p>

<p>The energy of the day continued as Netsky and High Contrast hit the Hospitality stage, dropping some of the most iconic sounds in D&amp;B and lighting up the stage with vibrant visuals. An outstanding end to a day filled with heavy drops and the only disappointment being we didn’t get a day two.</p>
