<p>The Four Seasons Astir Palace Hotel is a luxurious seaside escape located on a pine-clad peninsula in the Athenian Riviera, just 30 minutes away from the historical city centre of Athens and the Athens International Airport. With a rich history dating back to 1958, the hotel underwent a €650 million renovation in 2019 and boasts a unique blend of modern luxury and heritage. The hotel&rsquo;s interior design features polished marble, pale and interesting interiors, extravagant floral arrangements, and a museum-grade collection of mostly Greek contemporary art. The Vouliagmeni area, where the hotel is located, is a chic coastal town with countless beaches and seaside dining options, and easy access to the Greek Islands by boat.

<p>The hotel boasts 303 rooms spread across three unique settings: Arion, Nafsika, and luxury beachside bungalows.</p>
<p>Nafsika is the livelier and larger of the two buildings, offering sea views from every room and suite with glass-fronted bathrooms to soak in the mesmerising vista. It is the energetic hub of the hotel and boasts expansive, light-filled settings with three restaurants, a lively pool, waterfront, fitness centre, and luxury boutiques. The luxuriant interiors feature backlit headboards, mosaic marble floors, and giant mirrors that double as TVs.</p>
<p>Arion has laid-back rooms and suites that are perfect for relaxing, with modernist architecture and a more muted, grown-up atmosphere with a sun-bleached palette of sea blues and driftwood greys. The hotel rooms come with all the luxe amenities you would expect for a Four Seasons hotel, and also has a twice-daily turn-down service.</p>

<p>For the ultimate in seclusion and glamour, the luxury beachside bungalows are a must-see, bringing the golden age of the Athens Riviera into the modern era. These accommodations are ideal for those who want to experience the secluded seaside lifestyle of the Athenian Riviera. During our stay, we stayed in the Nafsika sea view room, a large and inviting space with a magnificent balcony overlooking the ocean. With the press of a button, we were treated to glorious sunshine and deep blue-green ocean views, making every morning a true delight.</p>
