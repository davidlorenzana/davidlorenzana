<p>With loans from museums and private collections around the world <em>After Impressionism: Inventing Modern Art</em> , includes some of the most important works of art created between 1886 and around 1914. While celebrating Paris as the international artistic capital, the exhibition also focuses on the exciting and often revolutionary artistic developments across other European cities during this period.</p>
<p>Starting with the towering achievements of Cezanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin and Rodin, visitors will be able to journey through the art of the late 19th and early 20th centuries created in cities such as Paris, Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels and Vienna. The exhibition closes with some of the most significant modernist works, ranging from Expressionism to Cubism and Abstraction. <em>After Impressionism: Inventing Modern Art</em> explores the main themes in the development of the visual arts in Europe at this time: the break with conventional representation of the external world, and the forging of non-naturalist visual languages with an emphasis on the materiality of the art object expressed through line, colour, surface, texture and pattern.</p>
