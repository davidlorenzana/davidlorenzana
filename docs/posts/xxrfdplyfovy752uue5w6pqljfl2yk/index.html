<p>An exhibition entitled <em>A Great Light</em> featuring works by Brian Clarke, a renowned stained glass artist, will be on display at Damien Hirst’s Newport Street Gallery from 9 June 2023. The exhibition, presented by HENI, will showcase an extraordinary collection of works from 2002 to the present day to celebrate Clarke&rsquo;s 70th year.</p>
<p>The exhibition will demonstrate the flexibility and wide-ranging potential of stained glass as a medium, from the towering Stroud Ossuary with hundreds of graphically etched skulls to the intimate Kabinettscheiben based on his latest series of collages and drawings. Clarke&rsquo;s earlier works, such as vibrantly coloured folding screens and large poignant leadworks, will also be featured. Additionally, his experimentation with method and process is shown in large battleships and beachboys from 2002.</p>

<p>Throughout his five-decade-long career, Clarke has consistently pushed the boundaries of stained glass as a medium, both in terms of technology and visual potential, resulting in impactful works that are fundamentally architectural. His reputation as a painter and an architectonic artist is based on major installation projects around the world, as well as smaller scale, autonomous works and international exhibitions of paintings and drawings.</p>
<p>***Date:***<em>from 16 June 2023.</em> <em><strong>Location:</strong></em> <em>Newport Street Gallery, 1 Newport Street, London, SE11 6AJ.</em> <em><strong>Price:</strong></em> <em>Free.</em></p>
