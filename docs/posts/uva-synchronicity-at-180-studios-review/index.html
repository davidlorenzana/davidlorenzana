But let us assure you, <em>Synchronicity</em> by UVA at 180 Studios is not one of those exhibitions that leaves you questioning the value of your ticket.</p>

<p>Founded by Matt Clark in 2003, UVA (United Visual Artist) has earned international commissions from prestigious institutions, thanks to their unique blend of light, space, sound, and custom-made kinetic instruments. Their work encompasses sculpture, performance, and large-scale installations, drawing inspiration from a wide array of disciplines.</p>
<p>Celebrating their 20th anniversary, UVA sets out to challenge our perception of reality in this exhibit. At first glance, <em>Synchronicity</em> offers a simplistic immersive journey, but it delves much deeper into the complex relationship between animals and humans, thanks to the intriguing audiovisuals by renowned bioacoustician, Bernie Krause.</p>

<p>The exhibition features eight large-scale installations, each exploring distinct themes. &ldquo;Our Time&rdquo; features three pendulums, each swinging to its unique rhythm, symbolising the elastic and enigmatic nature of time. A custom score by the late electronic musician Mira Calix accompanies this piece.</p>

<p>Next up, &ldquo;Polyphony&rdquo; invites you to step into a circular installation, immersing you in a soundscape inspired by field recordings from the Central African Republic, recorded by Bernie Krause and ethnolinguist Louis Sarno. This installation serves as a poignant monument to the songs lost in the wake of industrialisation and species extinction. &ldquo;Edge of Chaos&rdquo; lives up to its name, with its powerful sounds echoing long before you even see the installation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Etymologies&rdquo; takes a deep dive into the writings of Freud and Jung, generating new poetic compositions through the algorithmic rendering of their texts. This thought-provoking piece reflects the process of creation in an increasingly automated world, resonating with the AI-driven text we encounter daily on the internet.</p>

<p>UVA fuses light, space, sound, and custom kinetic instruments to craft immersive experiences, drawing inspiration from science, mathematics, and psychology. What truly stood out to us was &ldquo;Present Shock II,&rdquo; a dynamic data installation that confronts viewers with algorithmically generated intriguing news headlines based on current events and internet-sourced data. It highlights life-changing global events alongside the banalities of everyday life. This piece aims to shed light on the concept of <a href="https://jasonmbartz.medium.com/understanding-context-collapse-and-the-restoration-of-our-walled-gardens-1325bf527cf">context collapse</a> in our current digital landscape. Context collapse is a term for what occurs when numerous social groups blend together, largely thanks to the impact of social media.</p>
<p>While on the surface, UVA&rsquo;s exhibits may seem like an excellent, ‘Instagrammable’ exhibition, it in fact will engage your senses and challenge your understanding of reality through the enormous depth that exists within each installation.</p>
