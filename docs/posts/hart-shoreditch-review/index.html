<p>Located in the beating heart of Shoerditch, Hart Shoreditch offers a cosy, laid back and elegant base in which to explore all the local area has to offer. Inspired by East London’s past, the hotel&rsquo;s unique design is a celebration of Shoreditch and its heritage as a centre for craftspeople and makers. With a stylish lounge and co-working area in the lobby, you’d be forgiven for thinking you’d just walked into one of London’s many plush private members clubs…</p>
<h1 id="the-facilities"><strong>The facilities</strong></h1>
<p>Hart Shoreditch’s 126 elegant rooms provide guests with an authentic and welcoming hub from which to explore the local area. In the guest rooms, a soft palette combined with a modern design create a warm and welcoming haven, with the backdrop of vast windows that flood the space with sunshine and open up to an impressive city view. Carefully selected books and decor from local antique shops, along with bespoke carpets and fabrics made in East London, bring a taste of Shoreditch inside the hotel, from the carpets to the furniture. Distinctive style and historic homage are present throughout the rooms and the rest of the building, including its gorgeous meeting rooms, which can be booked for small brainstorms or larger presentations. Inspired by East London’s past, Hart Shoreditch showcases a unique design that celebrates the area’s heritage as a centre for craftspeople and makers.</p>

<p>Named after cabinetmakers who occupied the building in the 1800’s, Hart Shoreditch draws inspiration from the area’s rich industrial history and combines this with beautiful craftsmanship, resulting in a design masterpiece that seamlessly blends the vibrant heritage and modern-day creativity of Shoreditch to create a contemporary living experience. Old-world charm meets contemporary design.</p>

<p>Shoreditch is famed for some of the city’s most exciting restaurants and bars, but if you don’t fancy venturing out, Mostrador has you covered. Hart’s main restaurant is a family-style eating concept created by Fernando Trocca, who draws influence from the Latin American “mostradores,” or counter-service restaurants. Mostrador’s casually elegant atmosphere makes it ideal for everything from a morning coffee to a business meal to an after-work drink or a romantic supper for two. Think traditionalist with an exotic twist, with an emphasis on using high-quality, locally sourced produce – from delicate gnocchi and top notch burrata to my favourite of the night, a dish of cod fillet, langoustine bisque, fennel and katsuobushi. Take dessert back to your room if you are feeling particularly indulgent (as I did).</p>

<p>Enjoy a tipple at the Mostrador Bar before you dine – there is something for everyone, from classic martinis and negronis to more experimental options such as a coconut infused pisco sour. Sounds intriguing…was delicious! Breakfast can also be taken at Mostrador – imagine a fresh, healthy continental banquet of fruits, yoghurts, frittata, granola alongside cheeses and hams, filled croissants and array of juices&hellip;all to compliment comforting hot options of bacon, sausages and scrambled eggs.</p>
<h1 id="art"><strong>Art</strong></h1>
<p>Hart Shoreditch recently collaborated with artist and glass designer Rezzan Hasoglu who has created a stunning installation for the hotel’s lobby, a continuation of its dedication to work with local artists to deepen its history of craftsmanship and connect with the artistic community of East London. The installation, aptly named “Verrier”, will be a permanent feature in the hotel’s lobby entrance, and is comprised of delicate glass spheres, exquisitely hand-blown incorporating sand from around the world, are suspended from an iron structure and lit from the base, casting mesmerising ripple shadows that complement the hotel’s wrought iron spiral staircase. The work also pays homage to the silk weavers and Huguenots that settled in Spitalfields in the 17th Century.</p>

<p>The combination of copper details and natural tones created by the sand-infused glass spheres greet you with a moment of mindfulness and playfulness, while also serving as a reminder of the diverse trading history of the local area. The collaboration is a celebration of the rich history of craftsmanship rooted within the hotel’s DNA. Hart Shoreditch will continue to collaborate with a range of different artists over the upcoming months, ensuring that the hotel remains at the forefront of the cultural scene in East London.</p>
