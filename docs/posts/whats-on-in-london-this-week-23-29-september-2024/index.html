<p><strong>New murals in Canary Wharf</strong></p>
<p>Canary Wharf welcomes three new murals as part of the ongoing London Mural Festival, created by UK-based female artists Zoë Power, Hixxy, and Venessa Scott. Located on Bellmouth Passage by Crossrail Place Quayside, the murals explore themes of community and neighbourhood, reflecting the East London area. The artworks join Canary Wharf’s extensive outdoor public art collection, the largest free-to-visit in the UK. This marks the second collaboration between Canary Wharf Group and the London Mural Festival, following Camille Walala’s 2020 mural <em>Captivated by Colour</em>. <strong>Click</strong> <a href="canary-wharf-welcomes-new-murals-celebrating-community-at-London-mural-festival.html"><strong>here</strong></a> <strong>for more.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Napoli on the Road</strong></p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s food pick is Napoli on the Road, a Chiswick pizzeria recently named the best in Europe outside of Italy at the 50 Top Pizza event in Madrid. Rising from eighth place last year, it surpassed competitors like Sartoria Panatieri in Barcelona and Via Toledo Enopizzeria in Vienna. This accolade follows head chef Michele Pascarella&rsquo;s award as Global Pizza Maker of the Year 2023. Pascarella, who began his pizza-making career in Caserta at age 11, opened the Chiswick branch in 2019 and plans to launch a second location in Richmond.</p>
