<p>Boundary is perched on top of a boutique hotel in the heart of Shoreditch, and it offers panoramic views of Shoreditch. The rooftop features gorgeous citrus trees and an outdoor terrace complete with an open-wood-fire and cosy furnishing that will make you feel right at home. The rooftop is opened all year round with a menu that changes according to the season. Boundary is equipped to deal with the change in weather, and they provide heaters and blankets to keep you toasty in the winter. Expect to find cheese fondues in the colder months and a vast selection of seafood in the summer. Year round there is a huge variety of cocktails, wines and beers – you won’t go thirsty. But as a word of warning, Boundary can get very busy and sometimes there are queues around the block. We recommend booking in advance if you want to visit.</p>
