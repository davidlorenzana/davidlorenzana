<p>The Line is a 7.7km route from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to the O2 that follows the line of Greenwich Meridian. Known as London’s first ‘modern art walk’, the route is absolutely packed full of modern and contemporary art and there are a variety of sculptures and installations too. This outdoor exhibition is an amazing opportunity to appreciate nature and art all in the same breath. Expect to find works including <em>Anthony Gormley’s Quantum Cloud (2000)</em> and <em>Alex Chinneck’s A Bullet from a Shooting Star (2015)</em>.</p>

<p>The Jubilee Greenway was established to mark the 2012 London Olympics and the Queens Diamond Jubilee. The entire walk is split up into sections all the way from Buckingham Palace to Lime House Basin and is 60 km in total.</p>
<p>Our favourite part of the stretch is the route from Little Venice to Camden. Along this 3.7km route you will pass along the Regent’s Canal, Lord&rsquo;s Cricket Ground, Regent’s Park up to the often busy Camden Lock Market.</p>

<p>The Jubilee Walkway consists of five circular sections and features some of central London’s most iconic landmarks along this 24km walk.</p>
<p>Our favourite loop is the Jubilee loop, which is packed with interesting London landmarks. Starting at the southern side of Trafalgar Square, a 3km walk up to the Houses of Parliament will take you through Admiralty Arch into St James Park; past Buckingham Place and The Mall, up to Parliament Square, Westminster Abbey and finally to the Houses of Parliament where you can continue over Westminster Bridge and appreciate the spectacular views of the city from the bridge.</p>

<p>The Capital Ring Walk consists of 15 sections between Woolwich and Becton District Park, offering the opportunity to see some of London’s most incredible scenery, including scientific interest sites and nature reserves, along a route that totals 126km.</p>
<p>Our favourite section of the walk is Wimbledon Park to Richmond Bridge. This is an 11km route starting from Wimbledon Park that takes you through Wimbledon Common onto Richmond Park –  London’s largest Site of Special Scientific Interest. The walk is full of greenery and has plenty of hills and steep walks.</p>

<p>The Thames Path Walk stretches from the north to the south banks of the Thames, and goes past Hampton Court to the River Dent. Divided into four sections from the north bank to the south, this route totals 128km.</p>
<p>The Teddington Lock to Battersea Park section offers riverside views along a 24km route of the south side of the Thames, and passes Ham House, Petersham Meadows, Leg’o Mutton Nature Reserve, through Kew Gardens, along Lots Road, up along Chelsea Harbour and finally through to Battersea Park. If you are looking for a long stroll this is ideal.</p>

<p>There are several different options for Hampstead’s circular walk; our favourite is the longer 10.5 km walk, which features some of the highlights of the park, including Kenwood House, the Highgate ponds, and incredible views of London from Parliament hill. This walk is riddled with steep hills and beautiful views and provides a great workout. While you’re in the park we recommend you check out the hill garden and pergola for a well-deserved rest.</p>

<p><strong>Time:</strong> 2hrs-3hrs</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your looking for a bit of a shorter walk try this shorter loop that is under 90 minutes and will take you through parts of the park and Hampstead town, starting at Fenton House to Willow Road.</p>
