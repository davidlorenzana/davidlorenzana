<p>This September, Uncommon Holborn will host <em>Flying in Nuanced Colours</em>, a striking installation by renowned paper sculptor Pauline Loctin, as part of London Design Festival 2024. The exhibition, a bespoke commission for the B Corp certified workspace provider, merges traditional origami with modern art to create a captivating visual experience. Loctin, celebrated for her innovative approach to paper, has chosen Chartreuse and Hot Pink to represent two of the world’s favourite colours. Utilising GF Smith paper, the installation reflects the rich, creative energy of London, blending seamlessly into the vibrant atmosphere of the city.</p>

<p>Visitors will first encounter the installation outside Uncommon Holborn, where an undulating structure decorates the glass-fronted entrance, visible from all angles. Inside the atrium, a striking 2x6x5 metre piece will float among 6ft trees and greenery. Inspired by Loctin’s birdlike forms, it evokes a vast, sky-like feeling and offers a space for reflection and creativity, complementing Uncommon’s biophilic design which promotes wellness and productivity.</p>
<p>Pauline Loctin’s <em>Flying in Nuanced Colours</em> not only showcases her mastery in paper folding but also introduces a unique language of colour and form. The installation’s vibrant hues create a dynamic contrast with the atrium’s natural elements. During the opening week, visitors can participate in masterclasses with Loctin, learning her techniques and crafting their own miniature sculptures. This collaboration underscores Uncommon’s commitment to sustainability and innovative design, highlighting the transformative power of art in enhancing workspaces.</p>
<p>On 14 September 2024, Loctin and G.F Smith will host a fun, hands-on <a href="https://londondesignfestival.com/activities/a-paper-playground-colour-creativity-for-kids">workshop</a> introducing children to the ancient craft of paper-folding. Then, on 17 September 2024, they will offer a paper-folding <a href="https://londondesignfestival.com/activities/flying-in-nuanced-colours-manifestation-and-moulding-with-uncommon-and-g-f-smith">masterclass</a> at Uncommon Holborn, combining the traditional art with breathwork, music, and modern techniques.</p>
<p><em>‘Flying in Nuanced Colours’ is open to the public from 14 September 2024 at Uncommon Holborn, launching as part of London Design Festival 2024.</em></p>
