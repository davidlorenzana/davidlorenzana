The Nest is a welcome addition to London’s plethora of rooftop bars and is located just a short walk from Oxford Circus station. The bar sits on the 16th floor of the Treehouse Hotel which opened just under a year ago. It’s a quirky, green haven filled with wooden furniture and a wraparound terrace, offering 360-degree views of the city.
Whilst the food menu isn&rsquo;t particularly extensive, think small plates and light snacks, they do have a great selection of cocktails to make up for it.">

<p>The Nest is a welcome addition to London’s plethora of rooftop bars and is located just a short walk from Oxford Circus station. The bar sits on the 16th floor of the Treehouse Hotel which opened just under a year ago. It’s a quirky, green haven filled with wooden furniture and a wraparound terrace, offering 360-degree views of the city.</p>
<p>Whilst the food menu isn&rsquo;t particularly extensive, think small plates and light snacks, they do have a great selection of cocktails to make up for it. But if you in the mood for something more substantial then the hotel&rsquo;s main restaurant Madera is located just one floor below (15th floor) and also offers a similarly fantastic view of London. The restaurant serves a selection of Mexican cuisine and has several vegan-friendly dishes.</p>
<p>The Treehouse Hotel was founded by the 1 Hotels brand. The US-based company focuses on sustainable and eco-friendly hotels and has added London to its roster, with their other locations in New York, Miami and LA.</p>
