Who would have thought that hit Netflix shows Love is Blind and Too Hot to Handle would somehow become a reality for single people around the world?

<p>We’ve decided to investigate and see how easy it is to date virtually – here are some of the types of date that you can initiate right now.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c9534c4af4683461d462c6b/1589217342429-8CHKXILWM98A201A12QQ/nick-fewings-ka7REB1AJl4-unsplash.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="date-night"><strong>Date Night</strong></h1>
<p>Start simple with a virtual date night. Dress up, set a time and treat your date to a Deliveroo dinner. If things go well, why not surprise them with a dessert. Try and make the experience as genuine as possible, so tell your housemates to give you some space and don’t be late - there is literally no excuse!</p>
<h1 id="games-and-movies"><strong>Games and Movies</strong></h1>
<p>If the date goes well, suggest a simple online game such as Scrabble or Chess which allows you both to play throughout the day when you need a little break from work. This is way less intense than going straight in for virtual date number two, but still allows you to connect in a fun way.</p>
<p>If you have a free evening then why not suggest watching a film together. Netflix Party, Amazon Prime Video or Disney Plus&hellip; the streaming options are endless.</p>
<h1 id="special-delivery"><strong>Special Delivery</strong></h1>
<p>During these lonely times, it’s nice to send a meaningful gift to brighten up someone’s day. This could be a book that you have both discussed, or a something you have in common. Gift giving and receiving allows you to see whether your date is attentive and is actually paying attention during your conversations.</p>
<h1 id="heading"></h1>
<h1 id="photos-photos-photos"><strong>Photos, Photos, Photos</strong></h1>
<p>After a while you might get curious about their friends and family – and they might be of yours. As meeting people outside of your household is not currently allowed, sharing pictures is a good loophole. Photographs often have memories and stories attached and so are a great way of sparking conversation.</p>
<h1 id="room-for-a-plus-one"><strong>Room for a plus one?</strong></h1>
<p>Whilst quizzes might be getting slightly monotonous between you and your friends, the Zoom quiz is probably here to stay for a while longer. So, why not invite your date to join in the fun? A new face might re-energise the group, and it gives you a chance to see how well your date handles the pressure of meeting your friends.</p>
<h1 id="heading-1"></h1>
<h1 id="travel-the-world"><strong>Travel the world</strong></h1>
<p>Share your screen on a Zoom call and go on a virtual trip together – via  Google Maps, not actual travel. Share your last backpacking adventure, volunteer trips or family holidays. This is also great way to also find places you both want to visit post-lockdown.</p>
<p> We know it can get really lonely during this time, and whilst we can’t promise wedding bells for you and your Tinder match post-Covid, having someone to laugh with and someone to make you smile is definitely going to help. Who knows what will happen when lockdown ends and you can finally meet in person…</p>
