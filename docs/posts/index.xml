Departing from the usual art fair model of booths, Art Basel Qatar will focus on solo exhibitions by galleries, shaped by individual artistic visions. The fair is designed to create a more meaningful experience for visitors while spotlighting artists and galleries from the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and beyond.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
