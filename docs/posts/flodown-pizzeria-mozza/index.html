<p>It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve been on the pizza trail, or rather the pizza-in-actual-establishments trail. I was delighted when <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marinagpoloughlin/">@marinagpoloughlin</a> writing a sterling review of a new LA pizzeria in Oxford Circus coincided with my company opening an office nearby. Having excitedly told anyone I‚Äôd encountered at the office opening about my desire to try this (whilst letting them know I have a pizza blog), I managed to drag a few colleagues out of the local pubs and into the pizzeria.</p>

<p>Onto the wine list, or so I‚Äôd hoped anyway. I was not allowed to order until I‚Äôd filled out a paper(!) sheet on my profile so that my next experience could be personalised. I wondered how likely it was that I‚Äôd return and want to drink/eat the same wine and pizza.</p>
<p><strong>What to eat?</strong></p>
<p>Pizza Alla Benno ‚Äì Speck, Pineapple, Jalape√±os, Tomatoes, Mozzarella</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> ¬£15</p>
<p>Salame ‚Äì Tomato, Fior Di Latte, Fresno Chillis</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> ¬£13</p>
<p>Having carefully selected two pizzas, the wait began before we were served - this was not short. Perhaps one of the perils of having a sizeable pizza restaurant potentially without the staff to cover it. During this, the wine was stripped from us to be told that wine coolers weren‚Äôt a thing here (after pressing we were subsequently brought one). Finally! The pizza arrives and despite what might so far have seemed like a fairly scathing review, I couldn‚Äôt fault what then ensued. This pizza is different, light, crisp and sapid at the same time. The best pineapple-on-a pizza experience to date. After consuming the entirety you‚Äôre left satisfied with room for something sweet that won‚Äôt result in tipping over a metaphorical edge.</p>

<p>We did tuck into the Banana Gelato Pie which I should have known by the name, would be weird. A solid block of üçå flavoured ice cream had some cream, brittle and hazelnuts teetering in the vicinity but ultimately not having much impact.¬†Go for the pizza alone, especially if, like me you aren‚Äôt particularly versed with LA style pizza that combines thin crust with California style cuisine toppings.</p>
