<p><strong>Silk Roads</strong></p>
<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> Silk Roads explores the vast and intricate networks that connected Asia, Africa, and Europe, extending from Japan to Britain and Scandinavia to Madagascar. Far more than a single trade route, these overlapping pathways facilitated the exchange of goods, people, and ideas, profoundly shaping cultures and histories. Focusing on the period from AD 500 to 1000, the exhibition showcases objects from the British Museum and 29 global partners, including never-before-seen artifacts from Central Asia. Through stories of individuals like Willibald, an English balsam smuggler, and a Chinese princess who spread silk farming secrets, the exhibition highlights the Silk Roads&rsquo; role in connecting diverse cultures long before modern globalisation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Date:</strong></em> <em>28 September 2024 – 23 February 2025.</em> <em><strong>Location:</strong></em> <em>British Museum, Great Russell Street London WC1B 3DG United Kingdom.</em> <em><strong>Price:</strong></em> <em>from £17.</em><a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/silk-roads"><em>Book now</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>23rd Serpentine Pavilion by Minsuk Cho</strong></p>
<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> Minsuk Cho&rsquo;s vision for the 23rd Serpentine Pavilion, titled <em>Archipelagic Void</em>, breaks from tradition by decentralising the structure, turning the centre into an open space. The Pavilion comprises five distinct &lsquo;islands&rsquo; of varying sizes and forms, connected by a central void. These timber structures, supported by adaptable footings, sit strategically around the lawn, reminiscent of traditional Korean houses with central courtyards. Each island serves a different purpose, from housing a gallery featuring a multi-channel sound installation to hosting a library of unread books. Other structures include an auditorium for public gatherings, a play tower for interactive experiences, and a tea house that pays homage to the site&rsquo;s history. Cho&rsquo;s design encourages engagement with both nature and cultural exchange.</p>
