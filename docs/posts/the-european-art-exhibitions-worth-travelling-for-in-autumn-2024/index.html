<p><strong>Frans Hals: Master of the Fleeting Moment</strong></p>
<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> If you missed the Frans Hals exhibition at London’s National Gallery, you have another chance to see it at the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin. Hals, regarded as one of history&rsquo;s greatest portraitists, is celebrated for his lively and character-rich depictions of Haarlem’s citizens, genre figures, and social outsiders. His innovative style, featuring loose, bold brushstrokes, influenced many 19th-century painters, particularly the Impressionists. The Berlin exhibition showcases around 50 of Hals&rsquo; most significant works, alongside pieces by his Haarlem contemporaries, highlighting Hals&rsquo; impact on the evolution of European painting. <strong>Click</strong> <a href="frans-hals-at-the-national-gallery-review.html"><strong>here</strong></a> <strong>for our review of Frans Hals at the National Gallery in London.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Luis Roque: Estufa</strong></p>

Roque’s work fuses expanded cinema, visual art, and critical theory, blending modernist legacies, pop culture, queer politics, and science fiction into his timeless montages and speculative videos. His sculptural video installations skillfully balance form, colour, and content, fostering a dialogue between architecture and art while preserving their individual qualities.</p>

<p><strong>Venice Biennale 2024</strong></p>
<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> The Venice Biennale often feels fleeting, with the opening week passing quickly. However, the event runs until November, allowing ample time for visits.

<p><strong>Pierre Huyghe: Liminal at Punta della Dogana</strong></p>
<p><em>Liminal</em>, an exhibition by Pierre Huyghe in collaboration with curator Anne Stenne, features new creations alongside works from the last decade, including pieces from the Pinault Collection. Huyghe explores the human-non-human relationship, viewing his works as speculative fictions unveiling alternative world modalities. The exhibition transforms Punta della Dogana into a dynamic environment inhabited by evolving subjectivities shaped by captured memories. It&rsquo;s a ritual of unpredictability, inviting viewers to embrace alternative realities from an inhuman perspective</p>
<p><em><strong>Date:</strong></em> <em>17 March - 24 November 2024.</em> <em><strong>Location:</strong></em> <em>Punta della Dogana - Pinault Collection,  Dorsoduro, 2, 30123 Venezia, Italy.</em> <em><strong>Price:</strong></em> <em>18 EUR.

<p><strong>Breasts at ACP Palazzo Franchetti</strong></p>
<p><em>Breasts</em> examines the portrayal of the female form in art, focusing on depictions of breasts from the 16th century to the present. Curated by Carolina Pasti, the exhibition features works by over thirty artists, spanning painting, sculpture, photography, and film. It explores how breasts have been represented across cultures and traditions, touching on themes like motherhood, empowerment, sexuality, body image, and illness. By using breasts as a lens to discuss socio-political realities and challenge historical norms, the exhibition aims to promote awareness of breast cancer through the medium of art.</p>
<p><em><strong>Date:</strong></em> <em>19 April – 24 November 2024.</em> <em><strong>Location:</strong></em> <em>ACP Palazzo Franchetti, Venice, S.

<p><strong>Stedelijk Museum</strong></p>
<p><strong>#FLODown:</strong> The Stedelijk Museum&rsquo;s exhibition <em>Painting as Prop</em> by Wilhelm Sasnal features twenty-five paintings, some of which appear as props in his film <em>The Assistant</em> (2024). This exhibition delves into the intersection of art and film, bridging the early 20th-century narratives of Walser with contemporary themes of adaptability, capitalism, and the evolution of modern art. Additionally, those who missed the Barbican’s textile exhibition <em>Unravel: The Power and Politics of Textiles in Art</em> will have a chance to see it at the Stedelijk this September. Unravel presents over a hundred works by 45 artists, including Louise Bourgeois and Tracey Emin, demonstrating textiles as a potent medium for narrative in art. <strong>Click</strong> <a href="unravel-the-power-and-politics-of-textiles-in-art-at-the-barbican-art-gallery-review.html"><strong>here</strong></a> <strong>for our review of Unravel: The Power and Politics of Textiles in Art at the Barbican Centre, London.</strong></p>
