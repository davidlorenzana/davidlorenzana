<p>London is home to some of the most famous football stadiums in the world, so if you’re looking for something to do in the capital, and want to catch 90 minutes of the beautiful game, here’s your quick guide to the grounds you could visit.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c9534c4af4683461d462c6b/7a0bce7f-33dd-4ed6-b1b8-9b88c3fc3637/IMG_1513.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Emirates Stadium (Arsenal)</strong></p>
<p>One of the variables that a punter will consider in their sports betting is home field advantage; although not an exact science, a team will typically achieve better results in front of their own fans.</p>
<p>There’s a good reason why Arsenal are always among the betting favourites in the <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/football/english/premier-league">Premier League odds on Oddschecker.com</a>; their home form at the Emirates Stadium in Holloway is outstanding. In fact, since the start of the 2019/20 season, only Manchester City and Liverpool have claimed more points at home than the Gunners.</p>
<p>Built in 2004 at a cost of £390m, the Emirates Stadium has a capacity of just over 60,000, making it one of the largest sports stadiums in England.</p>
<p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (Tottenham)</strong></p>
<p>Opened in 2019 with a capacity of 62,000, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is the biggest football ground in London aside from Wembley Stadium and plays host to all sorts of modern conveniences.</p>
<p>Of the <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/spurs-tv/2017/september/new-stadium-world-first-dividing-retractable-pitch-for-our-new-stadium/">most captivating is a world first</a>: a dividing, retractable pitch, which can be removed to reveal another surface below, which explains how the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has been used to host NFL games as well as music concerts.</p>
<p>There’s also the <a href="flofavourite-things-to-do-in-london-in-september-2020%3Frq=tottenham%20hotspur.html">nerve-jangling Dare Skywalk</a>, which takes adrenaline-junkies on an adventure suspended 46 metres above the pitch.</p>
<p><strong>Stamford Bridge (Chelsea)</strong></p>
<p>Of all the stadiums being used in the 2024/25 Premier League season, Stamford Bridge is officially the oldest as it opened its doors for the first time way back in 1877. With a capacity of just over 40,000, Stamford Bridge is far from the largest football stadium in London, but the loud and passionate Chelsea fans are still able to whip up a raucous atmosphere all the same.</p>
<p><strong>Craven Cottage (Fulham)</strong></p>
<p>The London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham plays host to two Premier League stadiums, with Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge joining Fulham’s own 30,000-capacity Craven Cottage, making it one of the smallest Premier League stadiums.</p>
<p>At one time, Craven Cottage was a royal hunting lodge, no doubt in part thanks to its fantastic location on the banks of the River Thames.</p>
<p><strong>London Stadium (West Ham)</strong></p>
<p>The Olympic Stadium for 2012, since renamed as the London Stadium, was constructed for the sole purpose of hosting various disciplines at the Games. It saw all manner of world records broken, as well as Usain Bolt charging to an Olympic record in the 100m sprint.</p>
<p>Since 2016, the London Stadium has been the home of West Ham, who signed a 99-year lease agreement to play their home games at the venue.</p>
<p><strong>Selhurst Park (Crystal Palace)</strong></p>
<p>Croydon’s Selhurst Park was first opened in 1924, when Crystal Palace moved in. They’ve never left, although other tenants — including Charlton Athletic and Wimbledon FC — have since gone on to new pastures.</p>
<p>An intimate 25,000 capacity and ‘old fashioned’ construction, which means that the fans are closer to the pitch, helps to create a fantastic atmosphere at Selhurst Park.</p>
<p><strong>Gtech Community Stadium (Brentford)</strong></p>
<p>The Brentford Community Stadium, known as the Gtech for sponsorship reasons, holds just 17,000 spectators. However, the West London venue has plenty of charm, which is what attracted the London Irish rugby union team to request a ground share. They have, however, since gone into administration.</p>
