<p>South Bank puts on a host of special markets throughout the year, alongside their regular food and book market.  The food market offers a variety of cuisines from Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. These delicious foods can wash down with a range of beers, wines and cocktails all to be found at the market. Their range of dishes can often be smelt long before arriving at the stalls, so let your nose lead the way!</p>
