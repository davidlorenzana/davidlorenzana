<p>A group exhibition, <em>Only Until This Cigarette is Ended,</em> has opened at Pictorum Gallery, showcasing the works of nine international artists. Among them are Leily Moghtader Mojdehi, Tosin Kalejaye, Naomi Boiko, Olamide Ogunade, Elena Rivera-Montanes, Verde, Nina Baxter, Johanna Bath, and Brittany Fanning. Inspired by Edna St. Vincent Millay&rsquo;s poem of the same name, the exhibition delves into moments of reflection and nostalgic memory. Each artist presents a distinct perspective, drawing from their unique experiences, culture, and heritage.</p>

<p>Leily Moghtader Mojdehi, an Iranian woman living in London, weaves interdisciplinary textile works that explore her transcultural identity, blurring the line between collective experience and personal memory. Tosin Kalejaye, a self-taught Nigerian artist, creates portraits that convey his own ideas and experiences around the everyday Black experience, shedding light on contemporary Nigerian culture. Olamide Ogunade&rsquo;s paintings blend research and physical representation to address discourses around individualism, beauty, and race in a contemporary context.</p>
<p>Verde&rsquo;s paintings reimagine historical archetypes, challenging classical compositions and focusing on the power dynamics of the naked versus the nude. Nina Baxter&rsquo;s works capture the quiet moments in life, depicting relationships and shared meals in a way that carries a subtle melancholy and nostalgic feel. Johanna Bath and Elena Rivera-Montanes use photography as a starting point for their paintings, exploring themes of time, loss, and personal history. Their works evoke a sense of familiarity and invite contemplative engagement.</p>

<p>Naomi Boiko&rsquo;s watercolour on canvas works and Brittany Fanning&rsquo;s large-scale oil paintings delve into our relationships with the domestic sphere, animals, food, and the self. Through colour and fragmented imagery, they offer glimpses into their own lives.</p>
