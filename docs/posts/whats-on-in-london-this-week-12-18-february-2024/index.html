<p><strong>A dream Within A Dream</strong></p>
<p><em>A Dream Within A Dream</em> explores the delicate balance between reality and fantasy, inviting contemplation of the artists&rsquo; enigmatic narratives. Alya Hatta delves into the diasporic human condition, drawing from her experiences in South London and Kuala Lumpur. Sophie Vallance Cantor blurs boundaries, presenting dreamlike scenes where joy and detachment intertwine. Aysha Nagieva&rsquo;s paintings transcend personal experiences, while Rafaela de Ascanio celebrates empowered female figures. Candice Dehnavi explores cultural familiarity and memory&rsquo;s nuances. Together, the exhibition celebrates the nuanced beauty emerging when imagination intertwines with existence.</p>
<p><em><strong>Date:</strong></em> <em>2 February 2024 – 2 March 2024.</em> <em><strong>Location:</strong></em> <em>Haricot Gallery, 2 Blackall Street, London, EC2A 4AD.</em> <em><strong>Price:</strong></em> <em>Free.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Blush Upon Her Cheek</strong></p>
<p>Studio West presents <em>The Blush Upon Her Cheek</em>, an exhibition featuring Leo Costelloe, Florence Reekie, and Ki Yoong, drawing inspiration from Sir Peter Lely&rsquo;s Windsor Beauties. Costelloe explores gender and adornment through sculptural pieces, while Reekie liberates drapery to examine self-presentation and the beauty industry&rsquo;s false promises. Yoong&rsquo;s tender portraits revise Lely&rsquo;s idealised standards, emphasising each sitter&rsquo;s unique allure. Together, they challenge societal beauty norms, inviting viewers to reflect on the nature of beauty and its portrayal over time.</p>
