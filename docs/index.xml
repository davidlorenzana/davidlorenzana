      <description>Women have long been under-represented in the art world. In 2020 with what appears to be the glass ceiling breaking, we are seeing more exhibitions by women. To mark international women’s day and to commemorate the #5WomenArtists campaign we are sharing some of the exhibitions by female artists you can see in London right now and a couple upcoming exhibitions.&#xA;Dora Maar Exhibition Image: Tate&#xA;When?&#xA;20th November 2019 - 15th March 2020</description>

Now this is not for a lack of female directors out there, nor for a lack of female directors that have directed incredible films in the past 12 months - namely, Greta Gerwig&amp;rsquo;s adapted screenplay of Little Women.</description>
