      <description>“And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years.

      <description>“Privilege is about context and circumstance”&#xA;Girl, Woman, Other is an enthralling portrait of female experience. The novel follows 12 characters and most are black British women. Their stories overlap through their familial connections, friendships or through workplace networks, but each chapter focuses on a character and their individual story. Immense diversity is portrayed through these women, and it is through the difference in their experiences that Evaristo weaves such a rich tapestry of what modern Britain looks like.</description>
