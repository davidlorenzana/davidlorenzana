      <description>Image: MTotoe&#xA;The Nest is a welcome addition to London’s plethora of rooftop bars and is located just a short walk from Oxford Circus station. The bar sits on the 16th floor of the Treehouse Hotel which opened just under a year ago. It’s a quirky, green haven filled with wooden furniture and a wraparound terrace, offering 360-degree views of the city.&#xA;Whilst the food menu isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly extensive, think small plates and light snacks, they do have a great selection of cocktails to make up for it.</description>
