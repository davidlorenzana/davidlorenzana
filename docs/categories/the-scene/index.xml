      <description>The Globe’s 2024 summer season is off to a flying start with a joyous romp through one of Shakespeare’s much-loved comedies.&#xA;Ekow Quartey as Benedick and Amalia Vitale as Beatrice. Photography by Marc Brenner.&#xA;Sean Holmes’ production of Much Ado About Nothing is the kind of Shakespeare GCSE English teachers dream about. We are transported to the warm and hazy summer days of sixteenth century Italy, where trees are laden with ripening oranges, noblemen stroll through sun-dappled orchards and evenings are filled with the lively intricacies of dances and music.</description>

      <description>Christie’s has a wonderful summer treat for us all with their exhibition for the summer featuring Ahmed Mater, a leading Saudi Contemporary Artist. This exhibition, to date, is the most comprehensive dedicated to Ahmed Mater. I have become acutely aware my knowledge of artists from Asia and the Middle East is greatly lacking and I found this free exhibition to be a wonderful introduction which I am sure will propel me to seek out more work of artists from these regions.</description>

      <description>Hiroshi Sugimoto’s awe-inspiring photographs are currently on display at the Hayward Gallery. It is the largest survey to date of this artist in the UK and it is spellbinding, some rooms much more than others. For over 50 years, Sugimoto has been creating multiple extraordinary, enigmatic photographic series playing with light and dark, life and death, and these are all now on display for us to admire and question what is truth and what is not.</description>

However, just a short walk away, Beckenham Place Park welcomed a sea of bucket hats and became home to one of the most recognisable festival in Drum &amp;amp; Bass for the day.</description>

      <description>Kew Gardens 28th annual Orchid Festival has taken over the Princess of Wales Conservatory. Inspiration this year comes from the beauty and biodiversity of Madagascar which is home to over 1,000 species of orchid. We enjoyed leaving the crisp winter air of the gardens and entering the 24C heat to view the 5,000 orchid plants that make up this year’s displays. The flowers cascade over walls, along bridges and are erected into tall towers and arches to spectacular effect.</description>

      <description>We were keen to receive an invitation to tour this year’s 13th Edition of Sculpture in the City. There is something about public sculpture, which is extremely appealing, with each sculpture displayed with its own unique back drop and surroundings and the opportunity of accidental interaction with the art.&#xA;Temple, Richard Mackness, part of the 13th edition of Sculpture in the City. © Richard Mackness.

Curated under the theme of ‘Dialogues,’ the 2025 edition is coordinated by internationally acclaimed architect and Royal Academician Farshid Moussavi and explores art’s capacity to forge dialogues and build sensitivity towards societal concerns such as ecology, survival and living together. As Moussavi explained: “These dialogues can be between people of different races, genders, or cultures; between humans, all species, and the planet; or across different disciplines - art, science, politics for example.</description>
