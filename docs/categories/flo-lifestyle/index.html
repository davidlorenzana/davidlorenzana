      I had never been one for working from home before the lockdown, claiming that my job wasn’t really do-able from home (I can now safely say that’s not the case). But now that I’ve been forced to, I’m quite enjoying working from home and I hope that in some capacity it will stick. Here are some of the things that I’ve found useful for making it work (excuse the pun).

      Antisemitism is horrible. As with any discrimination, it taps into the worst corner of the human psyche – the dark feeling of control which flickers within a person when they abuse another simply because they are different or unfamiliar. Whilst Wiley was enjoying such crude empowerment when he spent over 12 hours last week bombarding social media with his antisemitic posts, Jewish people all over the world including myself were left bruised.

      What is the Coronavirus? By now we are all familiar with the term &lsquo;coronavirus&rsquo;. The virus currently infecting people around the world is COVID-19. COVID-19 is a member of the coronavirus family, which has never been detected until now.
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to serious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.

      In the last few weeks, the UK has watched as its European neighbours have started to reopen shops, meet with family members and enjoy some semblance of life before lockdown. Like a naughty child, confined to its room, watching his friends from the window as they play outside, the UK public have become increasingly frustrated.
Although the outbreak of coronavirus is a global pandemic, nations around the world have responded differently with countries such as Germany and New Zealand having relatively more success compared to the UK, America and Brazil who have experienced the highest death tolls.
