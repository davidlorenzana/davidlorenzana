      <description>Founded in 1997, the UK Jewish Film Festival is an annual event which takes place for two weeks each November. This year, the festival has gone online, meaning that it provides an ideal opportunity to immerse yourself in Jewish film from the comfort of your own home. The festival began on 5 November and runs until 19 November, with a number of fantastic films and events yet to be broadcast.</description>
