Sean Holmes’ production of Much Ado About Nothing is the kind of Shakespeare GCSE English teachers dream about. We are transported to the warm and hazy summer days of sixteenth century Italy, where trees are laden with ripening oranges, noblemen stroll through sun-dappled orchards and evenings are filled with the lively intricacies of dances and music.

Soojin Kang is a Korean artist now based in Germany, whose practice is based on the exploration of textiles as a sculptural medium. Using the ritualistic actions of weaving, knotting, winding and unwinding, she transubstantiates raw materials into structures that retain unmistakeable traces of their biotic origins through rough surfaces and natural dyes.

The Nest is a welcome addition to London’s plethora of rooftop bars and is located just a short walk from Oxford Circus station. The bar sits on the 16th floor of the Treehouse Hotel which opened just under a year ago. It’s a quirky, green haven filled with wooden furniture and a wraparound terrace, offering 360-degree views of the city.
Whilst the food menu isn&rsquo;t particularly extensive, think small plates and light snacks, they do have a great selection of cocktails to make up for it.

      Antisemitism is horrible. As with any discrimination, it taps into the worst corner of the human psyche – the dark feeling of control which flickers within a person when they abuse another simply because they are different or unfamiliar. Whilst Wiley was enjoying such crude empowerment when he spent over 12 hours last week bombarding social media with his antisemitic posts, Jewish people all over the world including myself were left bruised.

      On a sunny Friday we decided to make a day of it and journey to Greenwich from West London. We set off from Putney Pier via Uber Boat for the 90-minute trip to Greenwich to be tourists for the day in our beloved city. It is rather wonderful seeing the city from the water going under iconic bridges such as Albert Bridge, Westminster Bridge, Millennium Bridge and Tower Bridge and passing some iconic London Landmarks; Battersea Power Station, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, the Millennium Wheel, The Shard, Tate Modern, Tower of London and the stunning modern skyline of the Square Mile and eventually all the old shipping wharfs as we neared our destination.

Artists including Peggy Gou, Sub Focus and Black Coffee gathered in the press halls for a final send-off, creating the fantastic atmosphere and energy that the venue is known and loved for.

      The opening documentary of this year’s SAFAR Film Festival is a moving, first-person account of Mohamed Jabaly’s experience of travelling abroad and finding himself stranded, unable to return to his home in Gaza, forced to watch war unfold through his phone screen, and the community that forms around him as he fights to remain in a country that considers him stateless.
Life Is Beautiful.

      Arriving right on cue with the first wafts of summer London heat, the Royal Academy Summer Show has returned for its 257th exhibition. Curated under the theme of ‘Dialogues,’ the 2025 edition is coordinated by internationally acclaimed architect and Royal Academician Farshid Moussavi and explores art’s capacity to forge dialogues and build sensitivity towards societal concerns such as ecology, survival and living together. As Moussavi explained: “These dialogues can be between people of different races, genders, or cultures; between humans, all species, and the planet; or across different disciplines - art, science, politics for example.

Holly Hendry&rsquo;s art installation, Slackwater, takes centre stage in the Artist&rsquo;s Garden by Temple tube station. The installation features a maze of intricately entangled tubes, constructed with industrial-scale ducting, electricity spools, and inflated boat fenders. Representing the area&rsquo;s watery history and the abstract rhythms of the Thames and the human body, this large-scale sculpture will be on display on the rooftop site until September 2024.
