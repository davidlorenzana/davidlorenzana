      <description>“My work speaks with emotion. The surfaces I weave, the positive and negative space that becomes the forms that I create…”&#xA;- Soojin Kang&#xA;Image: Soojin Kang. © Markus Schroder&#xA;Soojin Kang is a Korean artist now based in Germany, whose practice is based on the exploration of textiles as a sculptural medium. Using the ritualistic actions of weaving, knotting, winding and unwinding, she transubstantiates raw materials into structures that retain unmistakeable traces of their biotic origins through rough surfaces and natural dyes.</description>

      <description>“Painting turns images into objects, and objects into fields of disoriented depths deeper than the flat edge of the canvas.”&#xA;- Joanna van Son&#xA;Image: Joanna van Son&#xA;Joanna van Son is a fine artist based in London. Born in Oman to Venezuelan/Irish and Dutch parents, she grew up in China, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and from a young age was attracted to the intensity of bodily representations in Baroque art, taking particular interest in the dynamic figurations in the paintings of Old Master Caravaggio, as well as Cecily Brown.</description>

      <description>“I also felt that my practice was liminal, because it&amp;rsquo;s between this space of architecture, writing, but also curating or education, a multitude of things.”&#xA;- Péjú Oshin&#xA;Image: Péjú Oshin. Photography by Jake Green, courtesy of Gagosian&#xA;Péjú Oshin’s career as a gallery curator was unexpected. After graduating with a degree in architecture, she found herself in the art world through volunteering and working with young people. Péjú&amp;rsquo;s commitment to community work and education led her to become a curator of Young People’s Programmes at Tate, landing her on Forbes 30 Under 30 shortlist for Arts &amp;amp; Culture in 2021.</description>
