Soojin Kang is a Korean artist now based in Germany, whose practice is based on the exploration of textiles as a sculptural medium. Using the ritualistic actions of weaving, knotting, winding and unwinding, she transubstantiates raw materials into structures that retain unmistakeable traces of their biotic origins through rough surfaces and natural dyes.

It’s been a while since I’ve been on the pizza trail, or rather the pizza-in-actual-establishments trail. I was delighted when @marinagpoloughlin writing a sterling review of a new LA pizzeria in Oxford Circus coincided with my company opening an office nearby. Having excitedly told anyone I’d encountered at the office opening about my desire to try this (whilst letting them know I have a pizza blog), I managed to drag a few colleagues out of the local pubs and into the pizzeria.

      Antisemitism is horrible. As with any discrimination, it taps into the worst corner of the human psyche – the dark feeling of control which flickers within a person when they abuse another simply because they are different or unfamiliar. Whilst Wiley was enjoying such crude empowerment when he spent over 12 hours last week bombarding social media with his antisemitic posts, Jewish people all over the world including myself were left bruised.

The Birth of Modernism, featuring over 130 works by ten prominent Brazilian artists. The newly opened V&amp;A East Museum will debut The Music Is Black: A British Story, while next year will also bring two major Van Gogh exhibitions—one at the National Gallery and another at the Royal Academy of Arts, where Anselm Kiefer’s work will be shown in dialogue with Van Gogh’s.

      We were keen to receive an invitation to tour this year’s 13th Edition of Sculpture in the City. There is something about public sculpture, which is extremely appealing, with each sculpture displayed with its own unique back drop and surroundings and the opportunity of accidental interaction with the art.

        Review: We wear our wheels with pride by Robyn Orlin

      I have arrived at the last of the four Van Cleef &amp; Arpel Dance Reflection evenings I chose to review, and I am now wishing I had the energy and time see every show of this contemporary dance festival. It has been a wonderfully diverse showcase, and it seems I saved the most joyous for last.
The full title of this piece—WE WEAR OUR WHEELS WITH PRIDE AND SLAP YOUR STREET WITH COLOR&hellip; WE SAID “BONJOUR” TO SATAN IN 1820—is a homage to the rickshaw drivers of Durban by South African choreographer, Robyn Orlin.

Like a naughty child, confined to its room, watching his friends from the window as they play outside, the UK public have become increasingly frustrated.
Although the outbreak of coronavirus is a global pandemic, nations around the world have responded differently with countries such as Germany and New Zealand having relatively more success compared to the UK, America and Brazil who have experienced the highest death tolls.
