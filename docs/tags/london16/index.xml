      <description>On a sunny Friday we decided to make a day of it and journey to Greenwich from West London. We set off from Putney Pier via Uber Boat for the 90-minute trip to Greenwich to be tourists for the day in our beloved city. It is rather wonderful seeing the city from the water going under iconic bridges such as Albert Bridge, Westminster Bridge, Millennium Bridge and Tower Bridge and passing some iconic London Landmarks; Battersea Power Station, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, the Millennium Wheel, The Shard, Tate Modern, Tower of London and the stunning modern skyline of the Square Mile and eventually all the old shipping wharfs as we neared our destination.</description>
