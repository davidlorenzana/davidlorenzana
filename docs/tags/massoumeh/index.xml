      <description>Hiroshi Sugimotoâ€™s awe-inspiring photographs are currently on display at the Hayward Gallery. It is the largest survey to date of this artist in the UK and it is spellbinding, some rooms much more than others. For over 50 years, Sugimoto has been creating multiple extraordinary, enigmatic photographic series playing with light and dark, life and death, and these are all now on display for us to admire and question what is truth and what is not.</description>
