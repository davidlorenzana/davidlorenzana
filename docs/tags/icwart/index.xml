      <description>“I also felt that my practice was liminal, because it&amp;rsquo;s between this space of architecture, writing, but also curating or education, a multitude of things.”&#xA;- Péjú Oshin&#xA;Image: Péjú Oshin. Photography by Jake Green, courtesy of Gagosian&#xA;Péjú Oshin’s career as a gallery curator was unexpected. After graduating with a degree in architecture, she found herself in the art world through volunteering and working with young people. Péjú&amp;rsquo;s commitment to community work and education led her to become a curator of Young People’s Programmes at Tate, landing her on Forbes 30 Under 30 shortlist for Arts &amp;amp; Culture in 2021.</description>
