In January 2023, the Royal Academy of Arts will present *Spain and the Hispanic World*, celebrating the unrivalled collection of the Hispanic Society Museum & Library in New York. This landmark exhibition will present a visual narrative of the history of Spanish culture, bringing together outstanding works from Spain and colonial Latin America, from antiquity to the early 20th century. *Spain and the Hispanic World* will reflect the great diversity of cultural and religious influences, from Celtic, Islamic, Christian and Jewish to American, African and Asian, that have shaped and enriched Spanish culture across four millennia. The selection of over 150 works will include paintings, sculptures, silk textiles, ceramics, lustreware, silverwork, precious jewellery, maps, drawings and illuminated manuscripts.
