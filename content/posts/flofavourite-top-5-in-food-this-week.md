We are into the fourth week of the government’s new [**‘Eat Out to Help Out!’**](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-a-discount-with-the-eat-out-to-help-out-scheme) scheme. It came into effect on 3 August and lasts till the end of the month, giving people 50% off their bill at thousands of restaurants across the country on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The scheme is designed to encourage us all to get out there and support the hospitality industry following the nationwide lockdown.

This week we have a mixture of restaurants to recommend to you – some of which are taking part in the scheme, and some that aren’t. Make sure to book a table quickly as restaurants are (thankfully) extremely busy!

**#FLODown:** Located in a former dairy, Campania offers a selection of homey Italy dishes in an effortlessly chic location. This classic east London Italian will wow you with its selection of seriously tasty dishes including their lamb ragu with pappardelle and paccheri with burrata.

The restaurant is branded with the sign *‘S. Jones’* which is a nod to the building’s previous use as a diary. Campania kept many of the old features including the bare brick walls which gives the restaurant a rather romantic, rustic feel. They currently have increased outdoor space to allow for al fresco dining.

Campania is located close to the [Columbia Road Flower Market](best-markets-in-london.html) and makes the perfect pit stop after some floral shopping.
