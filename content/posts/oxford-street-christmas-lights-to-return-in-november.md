On 2 November, the festive season will kick off on Oxford Street as its renowned Christmas lights illuminate the iconic London street. The city's ultimate holiday destination will shine brightly with brilliant white stars (and lots of people capturing Instagram-worthy pictures), creating that magical Christmas atmosphere we associate with London during this time.

As part of the 'Feel the Magic' campaign, Oxford Street will offer surprise experiences throughout the season, inviting visitors to immerse themselves in the joy of the holiday spirit.In the spirit of giving, Oxford Street has partnered with the children's charity [Starlight](https://www.starlight.org.uk) for their 'Stars for Starlight' initiative. Visitors can sponsor a star in the dazzling light installations, contributing to Starlight's mission of bringing play and happiness to children in hospitals during their stay, especially during the Christmas period.

This year's Christmas light scheme underscores Oxford Street's commitment to sustainability. The display, made from recycled polymer and featuring over 300,000 LED star lights, is 75% more energy-efficient than standard lights. Alongside this, the 'Magic Days' initiative returns, offering exclusive Christmas deals and experiences from various brands and stores.

The lights will be on display throughout the eight-week festive period, bringing festive cheer to the city.
