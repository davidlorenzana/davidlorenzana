Jasleen Kaur has been named the winner of the prestigious Turner Prize 2024, earning the £25,000 award. The announcement was made during a live ceremony at Tate Britain, hosted by actor James Norton and broadcast on the BBC News channel. This year’s award, celebrating its 40th anniversary, highlighted the exceptional talent of British contemporary artists. Kaur’s work, deeply rooted in personal, cultural, and spiritual themes, stood out among the nominees, which included Pio Abad, Claudette Johnson, and Delaine Le Bas.

The jury praised Kaur’s innovative exhibition, Alter Altar, for its unique ability to animate everyday objects through sound and music, creating a sensory experience that evokes community and cultural heritage. Incorporating materials such as Irn-Bru, family photographs, and even a vintage Ford Escort, Kaur weaves a narrative of solidarity and joy. Her approach blends the personal with the political, offering an intimate yet universal exploration of resilience and possibility. The jury commended her imaginative use of material and her ability to unite diverse voices in unexpected ways.
