Art Basel has announced the launch of its first-ever fair in Qatar, taking place from 5 to 7 February 2026 at M7 in Dohaâ€™s Design District, with preview days on 3 and 4 February. Departing from the usual art fair model of booths, Art Basel Qatar will focus on solo exhibitions by galleries, shaped by individual artistic visions. The fair is designed to create a more meaningful experience for visitors while spotlighting artists and galleries from the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and beyond.
