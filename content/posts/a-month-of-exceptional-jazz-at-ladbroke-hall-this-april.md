The month opens on 4 April with saxophonist Alex Garnett, who will be joined by Will Barry (piano), Ferg Ireland (double bass), and Will Cleasby (drums). On 11 April, the Micah Thomas Trio will make their much-anticipated UK debut, featuring Dean Torrey on double bass and Kayvon Gordon on drums. On 18 April, tenor saxophonist Fraser Smith will perform with his Quartet, including Leon Greening, Simon Read, and Steve Brown. To close out the month, celebrated jazz vocalist Emma Smith will perform on 25 April, alongside Jamie Safir (piano), Conor Chaplin (double bass), Luke Tomlinson (drums), and Zhenya Strigalev on saxophone.

Ladbroke Hall itself is as much a draw as the music. Originally built in 1903 as the Clément-Talbot factory, this Beaux Arts building was designed to reflect the elegance of an English country house. Over the years, it has hosted a variety of functions, from military vehicle production during WWI to housing Thames Television in the 1980s. In 2019, it was transformed into a vibrant cultural venue by Loïc Le Gaillard and Julien Lombrail, founders of Carpenters Workshop Gallery. Today, Ladbroke Hall is a multidisciplinary space where jazz, art, dance, and poetry come together, offering a dynamic platform for artistic expression and community engagement.
