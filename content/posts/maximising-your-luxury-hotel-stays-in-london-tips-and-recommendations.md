# Must-visit Luxury Hotels in London

**The Hoxton**

The Hoxton, with its four hotels in the capital, including a recent addition in Shepherd's Bush, offers a unique stay experience. The Southwark location, in particular, stands out due to its prime location and exceptional food and beverage offerings.

The rooms at The Hoxton are not just inviting and stylish, but they also boast a unique decor that has inspired other hotels around the UK. Scalloped headboards, panelled walls, and attractive soft furnishings give them a distinct character.

Communal areas are welcoming and adorned with contemporary art. Seabird, renowned for its [Latin seafood cuisine](flofavourite-seabird.html), is among the elite rooftop dining establishments in the city, and the ground-floor terrace Albie is the destination for chef and drinks collaborations.

The Laslett was named after Rhuane Laslett, a co-founder of the [Notting Hill Carnival](https://nhcarnival.org/carnival-info), is a boutique hotel influenced by its renowned area that warrants your attention. Adored by insiders and residents, the structure was transformed from five previous Victorian terraced dwellings. Now, it showcases contemporary interiors juxtaposed with intriguing antiques procured from the adjacent Portobello Road.

Guests may dedicate an afternoon to reading in the lounge prior to venturing out to explore the surrounding region. Henderson Bar offers an excellent all-day breakfast and a wide array of spirits and drinks, with afternoon tea available upon request on the patio. Additionally, hotel guests and visitors may now use the hotel spa, which has recently collaborated with Oskia to provide a selection of luxury treatments.

***Location:*** *Notting Hill.* ***Price Per Night:*** *£258.*

**The Twenty-Two**

The Twenty-Two, a hotel, restaurant, and members' club, has quickly become one of the most sought-after venues in the city, frequented by notable figures such as Tom Cruise and Kate Moss. Since its inauguration two years ago, this opulently adorned west London retreat has converted an Edwardian mansion on Grosvenor Square into an exclusive destination.

The audaciously designed guestrooms are intended for romantic retreats. They include red velvet furniture, marble bathrooms, and fully equipped minibars. The restaurant has a distinctive blue interior and offers a diverse menu, ranging from elegantly presented brunches to Sunday roasts. The private dining room is ideal for hosting a group, and it serves meals such as Devon crab salad and an exquisite caramel dessert.

***Location:*** *Mayfair.* ***Price Per Night:*** *£475.*

**The Peninsula**

The Peninsula London, which opened a year ago, overlooks [Wellington Arch](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/wellington-arch/) and Hyde Park Corner. The hotel, influenced by the architecture of Belgravia and next to three royal gardens, has approximately 200 guestrooms and suites. It also has a cutting-edge spa that includes a 25-metre pool, saunas, steam rooms, and treatment rooms for therapeutic massages, aromatherapy, and facial and body treatments.   
  
The establishment has many eating alternatives, including a rooftop restaurant that serves exquisite fresh British cuisine crafted by Michelin-starred chef Claude Bosi. On the ground level, the Cantonese restaurant Canton Blue commemorates the fusion of Asian and British cultures via innovative cuisine crafted by chef Dicky To, while patrons may also savour drinks at the Little Blue bar. Simultaneously, The Lobby provides afternoon tea, while The Peninsula Boutique & Café offers a casual grab-and-go option.

**Four Seasons Park Lane**

Located a short stroll from Hyde Park, the Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane is an ideal venue for a significant event. The hotel has 196 expansive and tranquil rooms and suites adorned in muted hues with luxurious textiles and marble baths, many offering panoramic views of the park or the London skyline.

The rooftop spa alone justifies a stay here. Visitors can unwind with treatments while enjoying panoramic city views via the glass-walled lounge. For contemporary Italian cuisine, visit Amaranto; for a more casual experience, go to the Amaranto Lounge for afternoon tea or drinks by the fireplace.

The amiable and vigilant personnel guarantee excellent care for guests; yet, if one can detach from the hotel, some of London's finest restaurants and stores in Knightsbridge and Mayfair are just a short stroll away.

***Location:*** *Mayfair.* ***Price Per Night:*** *£765.*

**The Ritz Hotel & Casino**

For nearly a century, The Ritz London has set the standard for luxury hotels. Since its establishment in 1906, it has been a haven for intellectuals, celebrities, and discerning travelers, adding a touch of history to your stay.

The Ritz London is a remarkable hotel with exemplary facilities, services, and personnel, making it an ideal venue for any event.

The breakfast and dinner experiences are remarkable, with exquisite cuisine and outstanding quality.

# Booking Tips for Luxury Accommodation in London

**Consider newly established or less-known luxury hotels**

Recently founded or lesser-known luxury hotels may offer promotional discounts or introductory prices to attract customers. These hotels consistently surpass expectations to captivate new consumers by delivering exceptional service and facilities at a reduced cost. Residing at these hotels provides the opportunity to experience opulence at a diminished price, with the exhilaration of a pristine and novel environment.

**Reserve directly with the hotel**

Booking websites, however user-friendly, may not provide the most advantageous rates for hotels in London. Numerous luxury hotels offer unique promotions, upgrades to superior room categories, or amenities such as complimentary breakfast and late check-out when reservations are made directly via the hotel's website. Hotels prefer direct bookings to avoid commission payments to third-party platforms, making these clients the prime beneficiaries of exclusive bargains available via direct reservations. **Loyalty programs**

Numerous luxury hotel businesses provide rewards programs that provide substantial advantages. Upon joining these programs, each stay offers the opportunity to accrue points for free nights or upgrades. Programs of this kind provide instant advantages upon enrolment, such as complimentary Wi-Fi and waived accommodation costs or upgrades upon checkout. If you are not a regular traveller, you could believe this does not apply to you; yet, staying in luxurious hotels is very relevant!

**Monitor pricing and set alerts**

Additionally, possessing hotel price monitoring software that may notify you of improved daily costs is advantageous. Your internet activities influence your travel itinerary; platforms like Google Hotels, Kayak, and Trivago enable customers to set price alerts for certain hotels, notifying them of any price reductions. This strategy, however arduous and protracted, may result in significant cost reductions. Furthermore, contemplate using applications to acquire last-minute bargains on upscale motels that cater to spontaneity.
