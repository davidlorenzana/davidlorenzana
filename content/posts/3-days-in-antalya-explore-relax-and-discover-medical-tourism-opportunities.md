Medical tourism has been on the rise in recent years, and Türkiye is the number one destination for quality, low-cost medical procedures. With all of its healthcare facilities accredited by The Joint Commission International (JCI), and doctors certified by the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS) and the European Board of Plastic Surgery (EBOPRAS), Antalya has become one of the most popular locations in Türkiye for all manner of cosmetic procedures.

But it’s so much more than a fantastic place to get quality medical care. Antalya is also steeped in history and culture. There are incredible ancient sites to visit and absolutely delicious local cuisine that you can’t miss while you’re visiting. So, if you have three days in Antalya, it makes sense to explore, relax, and enjoy yourself while you recover from your procedure.

**The Best Medical Tourism Opportunities in Antalya**

Antalya has so much to offer, and you can have anything from a Hollywood Smile to a rhinoplasty done under the care of their experienced surgeons. However, if you only have three days in this magnificent coastal city, there are other popular procedures for you to consider.

**Botox and Fillers**

Botox is a fantastic way to help reduce the appearance of wrinkles over time by freezing the muscles that our face uses when we make new expressions. It’s non-surgical, and it only takes ten minutes for the procedure to be completed. Similarly, fillers are a great way to boost your confidence by giving you fuller lips and helping them become more contoured and pronounced.

**Mole Removal**

Although not as popular as dental treatment and hair transplants, mole removal in Turkey can be up to 70% cheaper than in the UK.

In just a few hours, you can have all the moles that bother you visually removed from your body.

**Hair Transplants**

The most popular method for hair transplants is Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), which is where follicles are taken from the donor areas and transplanted to the top of the head. The donor area is usually around the ears and the nape of the neck, and when they are transplanted, it encourages new growth in the area where you are suffering from hair loss.

 It can be performed on men and women, and the results of the transplant are permanent once everything is done and the new hairs start to grow properly.

Those considering a procedure in Antalya often turn to DK Klinik—a leading hair transplant and medical aesthetics clinic that has been serving international patients for over 20 years, known for its experienced medical team, attentive aftercare, ISHRS membership, and transparent pricing.

One former patient, James, shared his experience—now listed on [DK Klinik’s review page](https://en.dk-klinik.com.tr/dk-klinik-antalya-reviews)—saying, "Very, very happy with the service. The aftercare was especially attentive. They have been very reassuring from the initial stages until now. Would highly recommend."

**Composite Bonding**

This is a form of filling and tooth repair that leaves damaged teeth looking better than ever. The decayed or damaged part of the tooth is removed at the start of the procedure, and then the remaining tooth is cleaned before a special adhesive is applied. After this, the composite bonding is placed on the tooth, leaving an aesthetic filling.

**Beaches and Culture in Antalya**

The east and west of the city are lined with gorgeous beaches and turquoise waters where you can relax on the sand or take to the water and dive to look at tropical fish and swim with turtles. The boat rides across the water are breathtaking, and there is even a pirate adventure tour for those who want to try something different.

An hour to the southwest of Antalya is the ancient Roman port of Phaselis, where you can explore a shale beach and the ruins of the ancient city that used to stand there. Aspendos is also fairly close, and this is home to the most well-preserved Roman theatre in the world. It’s spectacular to look at, and it’s one of those sites that cannot be missed.

The city is filled with Roman architecture, and it is also home to [Hadrian’s Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Gate), which is exceptionally well preserved. Old Town is the most historic district, and while the cobbled streets might feel like a maze in the beginning, the ancient walls and Ottoman homes are not to be ignored. The architecture alone makes the journey worth it.

**Where to Eat in Antalya**

Ayar Meyhanesi is a fantastic place to enjoy local cuisine in Antalya, especially if you enjoy seafood. The fish comes in fresh from the coast, and the terrace is perfect for those warm evenings when you just want to relax with good food and a few drinks. Not to mention, the dessert selection is absolutely delightful.

Pastorale is a great place to stop and try some traditional food while you’re in Türkiye. The kebabs and flatbreads are difficult to beat, and it has a warm and inviting atmosphere that will help you feel relaxed. It’s also right on the coast, which means you can enjoy the fresh sea air while you dine and recover after your procedure.

7 Mehmet is a long-standing favourite among locals and visitors alike. Known for its refined take on traditional Turkish cuisine, it offers beautifully prepared dishes with rich flavours. With views over the bay and a peaceful setting, it’s a great place to unwind and enjoy a memorable meal.

Antalya is one of the most beautiful cities in Türkiye. While medical tourism might be the main reason it’s currently such a hot location, there is so much more to it, and you’ll get to see it all during your visit. It’s possible to make your trip more than medical tourism; it’s a chance to relax, recover, and let yourself bask in the rich culture Türkiye has to offer.
