The Seychelles is an island nation made up of 115 islands (you can hop between islands via boat or plane, bear in mind a number of these islands are privately owned). With two UNESCO world heritage sites, the Seychelles also features the most breath-taking views you could ever imagine and is home to some of the most picturesque white sand beaches, delicious food and equally intriguing wildlife.

Here is our guide to some of the best things to do whilst on this tropical island…

# **The Beaches**

The beaches in Seychelles will without a doubt be amongst the most beautiful places you will ever visit. Most of their beaches are completely untouched and are a clear example of the beauty in an unpolluted environment. The temperatures remain around the 30 degree mark which makes for perfect beach weather.Whether you are looking to go swimming, snorkelling or simply watch the sun set with a sunset cruise you’ll find a wide range of activities available at just about every beach. We would recommend booking through the concierge at your hotel.

Beau Vallon is located in the north west coast of Mahe and is one of the most popular beaches on the island; watching the glistening sunset over the emerald waters is truly spectacular. Be sure to try the local beer Seybrew and palm wine, both of which are incredibly tasty.

**#FLOFavourite**: We recommend a visit to Anse Source d’Argent,(La Digue Island) one of the most photographed beaches in the world. The beach is located inside the L’Uunion Estate, a national park that you must pay to enter in order to gain access to the beach – but we guarantee that you will get goose bumps when you see it.

# **Seychelles National Botanical Gardens**

The Botanical Gardens is one of the Seychelles oldest national monuments. It is home to a wide collection of exotic and endemic plants, and the oldest inhabitants of the islands are actually giant tortoises from Aldabra, some of which are over 150 years old!

Among the several species of bird that you’ll find in the gardens are the Pizon Olande (Blue Pigeon) that are distinctly identified by their white (which some may say is blue, but definitely looks white to us) neck, red head and love of fruits.

Within the grounds there are a number of interesting exotic plants. Namely, the Cannon Ball Tree, which grows flowers and fruits along its trunk. It’s name is understood when the large, heavy and round fruits fall from the tree causing a huge explosive noise. Unlike its brightly coloured, delicately-scented flowers the the fruit it grows has a truly awful smell, beware!

**#FLOFavourite:** The Gardens also offer the opportunity to feed the tortoises (for a small price). We highly recommend this activity as it’s such a great and unique experience.

# **Rum tasting at Takamaka Rum Distillery**

Takamaka Rum is becoming ever popular in London with several bars stocking their product. Their distillery is located on Mahe Island and we highly recommend spending an afternoon doing their guided tour. The tour includes a chance to try the rum alongside learning a heap of information on the process and production of rum.

Located on the property is the distillery’s quaint restaurant, La Plaine St Andre, which actually sits in a restored plantation house. The décor reflects the tone of the era and serves up delicious traditional regional dishes.

**#FLOFavourite:** The property is quite conveniently located across the road from an exquisite beach. Be sure to check that out after enjoying a cocktail or two.

The [Valle de Mai Nature Reserve](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/261/), located on the island of Praslin, is one of two UNESCO world heritage sites in the Seychelles. The nature reserve is the original home of the Coco der Mer palm tree and features the largest population of this variation of palm tree in the world – which is how it earnt its word heritage status.

The Coco der Mer is the largest seed in the world and originates from the Coco der Mer palm tree. This tree is now endangered and is on the [World Conservation Unions Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/38602/10136618).

Aldabra is completely untouched due to its isolation and lack of infrastructure. It is made up of four atoll coral islands that enclose a shallow lagoon and are surrounded by a coral reef.  Thanks to the limited access to the island, Aldabra is home to over 150,000 Aldabra giant tortoises, the largest population in the world.
