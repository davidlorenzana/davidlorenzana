**#FLODown:** Yayoi Kusama's fascination with pumpkins, or kabocha, is rooted in her childhood, where her family cultivated the plant and surrounded her home with fields of squash. Kusama views pumpkins as a symbol of joy, comfort, and everyday beauty, often featuring them in her work as a stand-in for self-portraits. [Pumpkin (2024)](serpentine-to-unveil-yayoi-kusamas-monumental-pumpkin-sculpture.html) is her latest large-scale bronze pumpkin sculpture, standing at 6 metres tall and 5.5 metres in diameter. Installed in Kensington Gardens, it offers various viewpoints for viewers to appreciate its beauty.
