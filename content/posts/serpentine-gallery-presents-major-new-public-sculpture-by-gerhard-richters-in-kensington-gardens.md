Serpentine Galleries, in collaboration with The Royal Parks, is set to unveil a monumental new sculpture by renowned German artist Gerhard Richter. Entitled *STRIP-TOWER (2023)*, this impressive piece will be showcased at Serpentine South in Kensington Gardens from 25 April - 27 October 2024. This unveiling marks the continuation of a tradition dating back to Serpentine's establishment in 1970, of presenting significant public artworks within the Royal Parks, offering visitors an opportunity to engage with art amidst the natural beauty of London.

*STRIP-TOWER (2023)* is a testament to Richter's exploration of painting, photography, digital reproduction, and abstraction, themes that have defined his practice for over six decades. Drawing inspiration from his earlier 'squeegee painting,' Richter employs a method that involves digitally manipulating scanned images of paintings, resulting in intricate compositions displayed on ceramic tiles. The sculpture invites viewers to immerse themselves within its vibrant, dynamic forms, reflecting Richter's ongoing fascination with reflection, systems, and repetition.

They emphasised the significance of *STRIP-TOWER (2023)* as a three-dimensional embodiment of Richter's artistic principles.
