In a city where immersive experiences have become a dime a dozen, with each vying for your hard-earned money, it's no wonder that skepticism often prevails when new offerings hit your inbox. But let us assure you, *Synchronicity* by UVA at 180 Studios is not one of those exhibitions that leaves you questioning the value of your ticket.

Founded by Matt Clark in 2003, UVA (United Visual Artist) has earned international commissions from prestigious institutions, thanks to their unique blend of light, space, sound, and custom-made kinetic instruments. Their work encompasses sculpture, performance, and large-scale installations, drawing inspiration from a wide array of disciplines.

Celebrating their 20th anniversary, UVA sets out to challenge our perception of reality in this exhibit. At first glance, *Synchronicity* offers a simplistic immersive journey, but it delves much deeper into the complex relationship between animals and humans, thanks to the intriguing audiovisuals by renowned bioacoustician, Bernie Krause.

The exhibition features eight large-scale installations, each exploring distinct themes. "Our Time" features three pendulums, each swinging to its unique rhythm, symbolising the elastic and enigmatic nature of time. A custom score by the late electronic musician Mira Calix accompanies this piece.

Next up, "Polyphony" invites you to step into a circular installation, immersing you in a soundscape inspired by field recordings from the Central African Republic, recorded by Bernie Krause and ethnolinguist Louis Sarno. This installation serves as a poignant monument to the songs lost in the wake of industrialisation and species extinction. "Edge of Chaos" lives up to its name, with its powerful sounds echoing long before you even see the installation.

"Etymologies" takes a deep dive into the writings of Freud and Jung, generating new poetic compositions through the algorithmic rendering of their texts. This thought-provoking piece reflects the process of creation in an increasingly automated world, resonating with the AI-driven text we encounter daily on the internet.

UVA fuses light, space, sound, and custom kinetic instruments to craft immersive experiences, drawing inspiration from science, mathematics, and psychology. What truly stood out to us was "Present Shock II," a dynamic data installation that confronts viewers with algorithmically generated intriguing news headlines based on current events and internet-sourced data. It highlights life-changing global events alongside the banalities of everyday life. This piece aims to shed light on the concept of [context collapse](https://jasonmbartz.medium.com/understanding-context-collapse-and-the-restoration-of-our-walled-gardens-1325bf527cf) in our current digital landscape. Context collapse is a term for what occurs when numerous social groups blend together, largely thanks to the impact of social media.

While on the surface, UVA's exhibits may seem like an excellent, ‘Instagrammable’ exhibition, it in fact will engage your senses and challenge your understanding of reality through the enormous depth that exists within each installation.
