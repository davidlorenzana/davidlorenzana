FLO London features in the June, July and August 2022 issues of British Vogue. As a female-owned business this has been a wonderful opportunity and a chance to showcase our newest collection of Ghanaian wax print products made from Nsubra fabrics.

*“I created FLO London The Shop with the intent of relaying the meanings and beauty of some of the wonderful Ghanaian wax print fabrics I have been in awe of my whole life. It is incredible to see the brand represented in such a prestigious and high fashion Magazine such as British Vogue”*
