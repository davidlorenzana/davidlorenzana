Representing Zurich creative hipster style, Zurich West embodies everything we love about Shoreditch with its own Swiss spin on it; in other words, it’s a good time. Head to Zurich west where you’ll find recycled freight cabins operating as shops, boutique shops and eateries under the arches at Im Viadukt and Frau Gerolds Garten. Frau Gerolds Garten is like a cool Box park complete with containers, a beer garden, boutique shops, great vibes and music. It’s the best place to be in the summer time!

**#FLOFavourite**: Check out the amazing umbrellas hanging over the patio of Gerold Chuchi.*Insta gold!* Gerold Chuchi is known to have the best burgers in Zurich, and opens late on Thursday to Saturday, so you can get your late-night snack in.

# **Lake Zurich**

Lake Zurich is one of the most iconic features of Zurich, with views of the Alps in the distance. There are also several open swimming pools right within the lake, that open up as good time bars during the summertime! There are several cafes and bars surrounding the lake, where you can enjoy food and drinks with a view, or enjoy a picnic on the lake’s banks.

In the summertime you'll find the lake bustling with people on pedalos, cruising along in speedboats or hitting the waves in a canoe.

**#FLOFavourite:** Some of our favourite open pools:

 S*eebad Utoquai* is one of Zurich's most well-known promenade pools with several sun terraces and complete with diving boards. The pools are separated by gender.

*Seebad Enge* has amazing views of Lake Zurich and the Alps and offers swimming all year round with a sauna for those winter chills.

 You will also find floating swimming platforms along the two other rivers in Zurich, Limmat and Sihl.

# **Old Town**

The old town is home to some of Zurich’s most impressive structures from medieval churches to guild houses that date back to the Middle Ages. The Limmat River runs in between the old town separating the town into two parts. It is easy to get lost in the narrow cobbled streets of the picturesque old town, it is full of history, art, wonderful views and water fountains *loads* of fountains, over 1,200 to be exact, all of which produce drinkable water. Be sure to try some of the many restaurants and cafes located in the old town and book a walking tour to explore the history behind the cobbled streets and picturesque structures.

**#FLOFavourite:** The Lindenhof Hill offers spectacular views of the city, from the two towers of the Grossmunster Church to the Alps in the distance. There are often interesting chess games going on in the park, which can get quite heated but all in good spirit!
