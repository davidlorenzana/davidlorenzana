The Other Art Fair opened at the Truman Brewery on Thursday evening to heaving crowds of art lovers.

Art should never be elite and here you will find a wonderful variety at accessible prices with the opportunity to meet 100+ artists in person which can only enhance your experience of viewing or purchasing art.

The abstract sensuality of Anna McNeil’s work caught our eye (stand 22). At first glance, as one passes by, the works appear entirely abstract. However, upon closer inspection, the figures or outlines of a scene emerge. They are emotive, with each piece capturing a touch, embrace, kiss, or intimate proximity. The use of colour in combination is striking.

Our next pick is Oliver Mayhall’s fine art photography work (stand 100), featuring fascinating abstract and surrealist pieces, some with a notable Dalíesque style. He is self-taught, having begun with street photography, and now focuses on portrait and fine art photography.

Lastly, Steve McPherson’s (stand 101) primary source of material for his art since 2007 has been the discarded plastic objects that wash ashore along his local Kent coast line. His method is akin to that of an archaeologist, collector, or treasure hunter. His interest lies in the way that the mundane can transition through a transformative state into meaning.
