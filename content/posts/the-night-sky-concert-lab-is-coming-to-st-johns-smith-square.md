The Night Sky Concert Lab is going to be at [St John’s Smith Square this November](https://www.sjss.org.uk/events/night-sky) for two performances – one at 7pm and one at 9pm. The show will feature music from the Southbank Sinfonia, conducted by Olivia Clarke, and will be narrated by NASA astronaut Mike Massimino, whilst images from the James Webb Telescope are displayed.

This event promises to be an immersive, sonic journey into the cosmos that has been sparking curiosity since the beginning of time. The concert hall will be transformed into a planetarium, and audience members will lie down amongst the orchestra (cushions will be provided) and listen to the music themed around astronomy, whilst gazing at projections of the universe in which we inhabit.
