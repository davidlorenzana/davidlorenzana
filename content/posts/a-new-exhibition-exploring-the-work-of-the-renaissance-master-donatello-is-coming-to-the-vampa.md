Opening February 2023, *Donatello: Sculpting the Renaissance* will be the first major UK exhibition to explore the exceptional talents of the Renaissance master, Donatello. It will offer a fresh vision of the artist and his impact on both the cultural and artistic development of this crucial time in the history of art. Arguably the greatest sculptor of all time, Donatello (*c*.1386-1466) was in the vanguard of a revolution in sculptural practice in the early Renaissance.

The exhibition will explore Donatello’s innovations, collaborations and inspirations within the vibrant artistic and cultural context of fifteenth-century Italy, and his influence on subsequent generations of artists. Featuring many works that have never been on display in the UK, including Donatello’s early marble *David* and bronze *Attis-Amorino* from the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence, as well as the spectacular reliquary bust of San Rossore from the Museo Nazionale di San Matteo, Pisa, and bronzes from the High Altar of the Basilica of St Anthony in Padua. For the first time, the V&A’s exquisitely carved shallow relief of the *Ascension with Christ giving the keys to St Peter* will be displayed alongside the *Madonna of the Clouds* from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Desiderio da Settignano’s *Panciatichi Madonna* from the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, providing an exclusive opportunity to see these works together.
