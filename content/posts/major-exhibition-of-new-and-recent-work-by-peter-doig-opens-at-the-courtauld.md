Peter Doig is widely acknowledged as one of the world’s leading artists. He secured his early reputation in the 1990s as a highly original figurative painter, producing large-scale, immersive landscape paintings that exist somewhere between actual places and the realms of the imagination. Layered into his paintings is a rich array of inspirations, such as scenes from films, album covers, and the art of the past. His works are often related to the places where he has lived and worked, including the UK, Canada and Trinidad.

As well as showing a major group of Doig's new paintings in The Courtauld's Denise Coates Exhibition Galleries, at the same time, the Gilbert and Ildiko Butler Drawings Gallery showcases the artist's work as a printmaker with a display that unveils for the first time a series of prints Doig made in response to the poetry of his friend and collaborator, the late Derek Walcott (1930-2017). For Doig, printmaking is an integral part of his artistic life: his prints and his paintings often work in dialogue with one another. By showcasing this vital aspect of his practice, visitors will be able to explore the full span of Doig's creative process.

The works Doig has produced for this exhibition reflect his current artistic preoccupations, from remarkable landscapes to monumental figure paintings. Visitors will be able to consider Doig's contemporary works in the light of paintings by earlier artists in The Courtauld's collection that are important for him, such as those by Cézanne, Gauguin, Manet, Monet, Pissarro and Van Gogh. The exhibition will explore how Doig recasts and reinvents traditions and practices of painting to create his own highly distinctive works.
