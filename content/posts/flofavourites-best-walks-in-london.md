Walks have been very in vogue over the last few months, and London really does have a whole host of amazing locations for a wander. From an art-filled strolls, to walks along the Thames, here are some of our favourite places to walk around in the city.

The Line is a 7.7km route from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to the O2 that follows the line of Greenwich Meridian. Known as London’s first ‘modern art walk’, the route is absolutely packed full of modern and contemporary art and there are a variety of sculptures and installations too. This outdoor exhibition is an amazing opportunity to appreciate nature and art all in the same breath. Expect to find works including *Anthony Gormley’s Quantum Cloud (2000)* and *Alex Chinneck’s A Bullet from a Shooting Star (2015)*.

The Jubilee Greenway was established to mark the 2012 London Olympics and the Queens Diamond Jubilee. The entire walk is split up into sections all the way from Buckingham Palace to Lime House Basin and is 60 km in total.

Our favourite part of the stretch is the route from Little Venice to Camden. Along this 3.7km route you will pass along the Regent’s Canal, Lord's Cricket Ground, Regent’s Park up to the often busy Camden Lock Market.

The Jubilee Walkway consists of five circular sections and features some of central London’s most iconic landmarks along this 24km walk.

Our favourite loop is the Jubilee loop, which is packed with interesting London landmarks. Starting at the southern side of Trafalgar Square, a 3km walk up to the Houses of Parliament will take you through Admiralty Arch into St James Park; past Buckingham Place and The Mall, up to Parliament Square, Westminster Abbey and finally to the Houses of Parliament where you can continue over Westminster Bridge and appreciate the spectacular views of the city from the bridge.

There are several different options for Hampstead’s circular walk; our favourite is the longer 10.5 km walk, which features some of the highlights of the park, including Kenwood House, the Highgate ponds, and incredible views of London from Parliament hill. This walk is riddled with steep hills and beautiful views and provides a great workout. While you’re in the park we recommend you check out the hill garden and pergola for a well-deserved rest.

**Time:** 2hrs-3hrs

Alternatively, if your looking for a bit of a shorter walk try this shorter loop that is under 90 minutes and will take you through parts of the park and Hampstead town, starting at Fenton House to Willow Road.
