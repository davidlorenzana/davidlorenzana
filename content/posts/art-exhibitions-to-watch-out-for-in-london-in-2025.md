Announcements are already rolling in for London’s 2025 art exhibitions, and the line-up is shaping up splendidly. Highlights include the UK’s first exhibition dedicated to José María Velasco, Mexico’s acclaimed 19th-century painter, and the Royal Academy’s *Brasil! Brasil! The Birth of Modernism*, featuring over 130 works by ten prominent Brazilian artists. The newly opened V&A East Museum will debut *The Music Is Black: A British Story*, while next year will also bring two major Van Gogh exhibitions—one at the National Gallery and another at the Royal Academy of Arts, where Anselm Kiefer’s work will be shown in dialogue with Van Gogh’s. Here are some of the art exhibitions announced for London in 2025 so far. *More details will be added as further announcements are made.*

**#FLODown:** The National Gallery will host the UK’s first exhibition on José María Velasco, Mexico’s renowned 19th-century painter. *José María Velasco: A View of Mexico* celebrates the 200th anniversary of UK-Mexico diplomatic relations and highlights Velasco’s detailed depictions of Mexico’s landscapes and industrialisation. The exhibition will connect his work with pieces from the Gallery’s collection, such as Édouard Manet’s *The Execution of Maximilian*, and address themes of colonialism and ecological change. It will also feature a catalogue with new research on Velasco, reflecting the National Gallery’s ongoing effort to introduce British audiences to non-European art.

**#FLODown:** London-based painter Christina Kimeze's first solo show in London will open at the South London Gallery (SLG) in January 2025. Her paintings often feature solitary female figures in natural landscapes or abstract interiors, focusing on isolated architectural elements. Inspired by her friends, family, and herself, these figures explore the feeling of existing between two emotional spaces and a sense of "otherness." Drawing from her memories of Uganda and literary influences from Black, feminist 20th-century writers, Kimeze's work captures themes of remembering and identity.

**#FLODown:** This spring, Tate Modern will celebrate the provocative career of Leigh Bowery (1961-1994), an artist known for his boundary-pushing work across fashion, performance, and art. The exhibition *Leigh Bowery!* will showcase his outlandish costumes, paintings, photography, and videos, highlighting his influence on art, fashion, and popular culture. Bowery’s journey from a young boy in Melbourne to a globally recognized cultural figure will be explored, with a focus on his impact on London’s nightlife and the launch of his iconic club night Taboo in 1985. The exhibition will also feature collaborations with figures like Lucian Freud, as well as his performance art, such as the ‘mirror’ performance and his infamous ‘birth’ performances. Bowery’s creativity extended to music with his band Minty, and his final performance in 1994 marked the far-reaching influence he had on art and fashion.

**#FLODown:** In summer 2025, Dulwich Picture Gallery will present Rachel Jones’ first solo contemporary exhibition, featuring new works that explore identity and the inner self. Jones, whose previous exhibitions include the Museum of African Diaspora (2024) and Chisenhale Gallery (2022), will create pieces that engage with the Gallery’s collection.
