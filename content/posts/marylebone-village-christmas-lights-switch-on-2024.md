Marylebone Village Christmas festivities return on 13 November 2024.

Marylebone Village is set to kick off the festive season with its annual Christmas lights switch-on event, taking place on Wednesday 13 November 2024. From 3–8pm, visitors can enjoy a magical evening of festive activities, an artisan market, live music, and late-night shopping. The much-loved Merry Marylebone event has become a highlight of London’s festive calendar, drawing locals and visitors alike to the heart of the village for an unforgettable start to the Christmas season.

The evening’s main stage, located on Devonshire Street, will host a variety of musical and choral performances, adding to the festive atmosphere. BBC broadcaster and Marylebone Village resident Jo Good will return as the host of the event, leading the countdown to the Christmas lights switch-on at 6pm. A celebrity guest, soon to be announced, will have the honour of lighting up the village. Previous stars who have had this privilege include Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Fearne Cotton, and Roman and Martin Kemp.

In addition to the lights, visitors can enjoy an array of festive activities throughout the village. From bauble and wreath-making workshops to Santa’s Grotto and a Ferris whee. The artisan market will offer delicious street food, seasonal treats, and a variety of craft and fashion items – perfect for those looking to do some early Christmas shopping.
