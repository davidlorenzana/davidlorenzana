Women have long been under-represented in the art world. In 2020 with what appears to be the glass ceiling breaking, we are seeing more exhibitions by women.  To mark international women’s day and to commemorate the [#5WomenArtists](https://nmwa.org/5WomenArtists) campaign we are sharing some of the exhibitions by female artists you can see in London right now and a couple upcoming exhibitions.
