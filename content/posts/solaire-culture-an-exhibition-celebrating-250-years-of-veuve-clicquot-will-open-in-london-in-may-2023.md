*SOLAIRE CULTURE* celebrates Veuve Clicquot's 250 years of history, focusing on the legacy of Madame Clicquot, one of the world's first female entrepreneurs who took over the reins of the house in 1805, and the contemporary vision of the curator, Camille Morineau, and designer Constance Guisset. The exhibition also features Veuve Clicquot's cultural footprint and showcases the creation of its iconic Yellow label, which was created specifically for the British Champagne drinker. The exhibition features renowned female artists, including Yayoi Kusama, Cece Philips, Rosie McGuinness, Sheila Hicks, and Moyoco Anno, who have created original artworks inspired by Madame Clicquot and the power of the sun, paying tribute to the House's yellow label, and showcasing the bold and optimistic nature of the modern-day champagne house through an immersive journey.
