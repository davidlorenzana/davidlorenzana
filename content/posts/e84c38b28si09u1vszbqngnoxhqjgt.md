* Preheat oven to 180 C degrees and prepare the muffin liners and muffin tin.
* In a medium bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.
* In a separate bowl mix the coconut oil and Natvia together. Add the eggs and combine. Mix in lemon extract, lemon zest, lemon juice and greek yoghurt.
* Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until combined. Fold in the poppy seeds.
* Fill muffin tins about ⅔ full with muffin batter. Bake for 12-15 minutes until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.

Leave to on a wire rack for a few minutes before tucking in. And enjoy!
