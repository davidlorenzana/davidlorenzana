*These chocolate & hazelnut protein chunk cookies are sugar-free, soft in the middle and easy to make. By swapping a few ingredients you can play with flavours and textures and create something for your personal taste or dietary requirements. Inspired by Barebells protein bars, classic chocolate chips are replaced in this recipe with Barebells hazelnut and a nougat protein bar. The bars are high in protein and are completely free from added sugar.*
