Columbia Road Flower Market situated in trendy Shoreditch is home to several flower stalls. You’ll find friendly traders selling buckets full of the finest cut flowers, bulbs, herbs and garden fittings. Dubbed one of the ‘prettiest’ markets in London, this is without a doubt our favourite market in London!

The market gets very busy from midday, and we would recommend arriving early if you are looking to avoid the crowds, scoop up your flowers and be on your way. Arrive as the market is winding down and you may bag yourself some of the best bargains!

South Bank puts on a host of special markets throughout the year, alongside their regular food and book market.  The food market offers a variety of cuisines from Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. These delicious foods can wash down with a range of beers, wines and cocktails all to be found at the market. Their range of dishes can often be smelt long before arriving at the stalls, so let your nose lead the way!

Also within the vicinity is the South Bank Centre book market, one of the only outdoor book markets in London. Hidden under Waterloo Bridge, the market is home to a selection of great second-hand books and is one of our favourite places to pick up an interesting read.

This is London’s historic market located in the heart of the UNESCO world heritage site, Greenwich. Dating back to the 1700s, the market is full of artistic and creative pieces.

When you have finished jump on the riverboat back into central London. Or why not try the Emirates zip line.
