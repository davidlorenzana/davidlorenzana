A group exhibition, *Only Until This Cigarette is Ended,* has opened at Pictorum Gallery, showcasing the works of nine international artists. Among them are Leily Moghtader Mojdehi, Tosin Kalejaye, Naomi Boiko, Olamide Ogunade, Elena Rivera-Montanes, Verde, Nina Baxter, Johanna Bath, and Brittany Fanning. Inspired by Edna St. Vincent Millay's poem of the same name, the exhibition delves into moments of reflection and nostalgic memory. Each artist presents a distinct perspective, drawing from their unique experiences, culture, and heritage.

Leily Moghtader Mojdehi, an Iranian woman living in London, weaves interdisciplinary textile works that explore her transcultural identity, blurring the line between collective experience and personal memory. Tosin Kalejaye, a self-taught Nigerian artist, creates portraits that convey his own ideas and experiences around the everyday Black experience, shedding light on contemporary Nigerian culture. Olamide Ogunade's paintings blend research and physical representation to address discourses around individualism, beauty, and race in a contemporary context.

Verde's paintings reimagine historical archetypes, challenging classical compositions and focusing on the power dynamics of the naked versus the nude. Nina Baxter's works capture the quiet moments in life, depicting relationships and shared meals in a way that carries a subtle melancholy and nostalgic feel. Johanna Bath and Elena Rivera-Montanes use photography as a starting point for their paintings, exploring themes of time, loss, and personal history. Their works evoke a sense of familiarity and invite contemplative engagement.
