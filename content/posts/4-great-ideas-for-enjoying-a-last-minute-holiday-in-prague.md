Tourism in Prague is thriving, which means it's the perfect time to visit. The city collaborates with the PCT each year to promote [domestic tourism](https://www.praguemorning.cz/tourism-in-prague-2023/) and welcome tourists. According to František Cipro, director of Prague City Tourism (PCT), Prague will welcome nearly eight million visitors in 2023. The city is host to a variety of hotels, guesthouses, and experiences that exemplify the classic glamour of old Europe.  
   
 These options are available for even the most spontaneous traveller as the city expects an uptick in direct air links that can help make travel to Prague much easier. The idea of such [last-minute holidays](https://www.easyjet.com/en/holidays/last-minute-holidays) may seem daunting, but they are actually a fantastic way to escape your regular routine for a few days. Prague, in particular, is only a two-hour flight from the UK, and there are plenty of packages offered by holiday deal pages to suit every budget. This means you can secure your flights, hotel, and luggage with only a few clicks and immediately be ready to fly off to The City of a Hundred Spires.  
   
Upon landing in Prague, however, what's there for a spontaneous traveller to do? If you're unsure where to start, no worries. This article unveils four wonderful activities to relish during your impromptu trip to Prague.

Explore Prague's rich history and architecture by wandering through its storied streets. With various [well-preserved landmarks](a-guide-to-being-a-culture-vulture-in-prague.html) like Prague Castle, you can bask in the city's architectural splendour without needing to book tickets in advance. Stroll through the charming castle grounds in the early morning to avoid the crowds of tourists and long security lines. If you're lucky enough, you can catch a show at the Estates Theatre. You can purchase tickets for performances online, but you can also drop by the box office to purchase on-site. Otherwise, admire the classicist style of the building, which has been preserved almost entirely in its original state.

# **Outdoor escapades**

Engage in outdoor activities that capture the essence of Prague's dynamic spirit. Different modes of transportation in Prague serve as unique experiences in themselves. You can choose to rent a bike and embark on a leisurely ride along the Vltava River or catch one of the commuter ferries for scenic views.You can even take a 20-minute walk to the vast, grassy space of Riegrovy Sady for a bite to eat and a beverage. Many of these recreational activities don't require prior reservations, allowing you to enjoy the thrill of the moment.

# **Serene parks**

Prague has an array of serene parks that offer respite from the bustling urban landscape. Besides Stromovka, the biggest park in the centre, there's also Prokopské údoli. The latter is a limestone valley lined with caves and disused quarries where you can walk leisurely or even hunt for fossils. Otherwise, there's also Letna Park, whose expansive lawns and beer gardens provide an excellent spot for people-watching. These green spaces allow you to unwind without any planning in advance, making them perfect for embracing the spontaneity of your holiday.

# **Culinary adventures**

While establishments such as Klášterní šenk and Jelica are crowd favourites in Prague, the [culinary delights](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/11/locals-guide-to-prague-czech-republic-best-beer-and-architecture) of the city go beyond traditional restaurants. The city offers a plethora of markets at Prague 6, where you can indulge in local blueberry jam or tasty Olomouc cheese on the side of the road.This allows you to treat your taste buds to the flavours of Prague without the need for reservations or extensive planning. If you have a few hours to spare, however, you might just be able to secure a pint of craft ale at Krkonošska hospůdka, a mountain lodge-style pub, by calling the owner Dave in advance.
