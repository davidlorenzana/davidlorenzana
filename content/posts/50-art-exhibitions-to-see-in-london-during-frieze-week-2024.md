**Zaha Hadid: Paper Museums**

**#FLODown:** The Zaha Hadid Foundation’s exhibition, *Zaha Hadid: Paper Museums*, highlights paper reliefs crucial to Zaha Hadid Architects' design process. It focuses on their significance to three major museum projects: the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, MAXXI Museum in Rome, and the unrealised Museum of Islamic Art in Doha. These paper reliefs, created between the late 1990s and early 2000s, reveal the evolution of Hadid's architectural vision, bridging her two-dimensional paintings with innovative three-dimensional concepts. The exhibition features abstract reliefs for CAC, a perspective-based relief of MAXXI, and various studies for the Museum of Islamic Art, illustrating space optimisation and flow.

**23rd Serpentine Pavilion by Minsuk Cho**

**#FLODown:** Minsuk Cho's vision for the 23rd Serpentine Pavilion, titled *Archipelagic Void*, breaks from tradition by decentralising the structure, turning the centre into an open space. The Pavilion comprises five distinct 'islands' of varying sizes and forms, connected by a central void. These timber structures, supported by adaptable footings, sit strategically around the lawn, reminiscent of traditional Korean houses with central courtyards. Each island serves a different purpose, from housing a gallery featuring a multi-channel sound installation to hosting a library of unread books. Other structures include an auditorium for public gatherings, a play tower for interactive experiences, and a tea house that pays homage to the site's history. Cho's design encourages engagement with both nature and cultural exchange.
