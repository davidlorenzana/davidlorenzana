Doyle Wham presents the first solo exhibition of Kenyan based photographer and filmmaker, Margaret Ngigi, in the UK. The exhibition explores the complex pressures facing young women in contemporary Kenyan society. Ngigi states that *“Murky Waters is my way of examining the challenges that women still face in society, by illustrating the positions we are forced into, and the situations that different groups of women find themselves in.”*

Her Murky Waters series is set in the mesmerising surrounds of Lake Magadi and offers commentary on these complex issues through a unique, monochromatic lens.
