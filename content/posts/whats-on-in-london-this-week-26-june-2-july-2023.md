Image: Portrait of Haley Josephs in her studio  © Haley Josephs

Drawing inspiration from notions of transformation, mortality, and femininity, Haley Josephs paints solitary figures in fantastical yet foreboding environments that transcend time and space. A recurring character within Josephs' work is the artist's late sister, who is often evoked in bold, almost daring, portraits that amalgamate intimate and personal narratives of the artist with the universal human condition. New York-based Josephs' paintings have been exhibited internationally, including at the Cleveland Institute of Art. Her work is in the collection of the X Museum, Beijing. ***Click*** [***here***](in-conversation-with-haley-josephs.html) ***to read the full interview.***
