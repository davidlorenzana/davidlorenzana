The Four Seasons Astir Palace Hotel is a luxurious seaside escape located on a pine-clad peninsula in the Athenian Riviera, just 30 minutes away from the historical city centre of Athens and the Athens International Airport. With a rich history dating back to 1958, the hotel underwent a €650 million renovation in 2019 and boasts a unique blend of modern luxury and heritage. The hotel's interior design features polished marble, pale and interesting interiors, extravagant floral arrangements, and a museum-grade collection of mostly Greek contemporary art. The Vouliagmeni area, where the hotel is located, is a chic coastal town with countless beaches and seaside dining options, and easy access to the Greek Islands by boat. The legendary resort is a highly sought-after destination for travellers seeking luxury and history.

The hotel boasts 303 rooms spread across three unique settings: Arion, Nafsika, and luxury beachside bungalows.

Nafsika is the livelier and larger of the two buildings, offering sea views from every room and suite with glass-fronted bathrooms to soak in the mesmerising vista. It is the energetic hub of the hotel and boasts expansive, light-filled settings with three restaurants, a lively pool, waterfront, fitness centre, and luxury boutiques. The luxuriant interiors feature backlit headboards, mosaic marble floors, and giant mirrors that double as TVs.

Arion has laid-back rooms and suites that are perfect for relaxing, with modernist architecture and a more muted, grown-up atmosphere with a sun-bleached palette of sea blues and driftwood greys. The hotel rooms come with all the luxe amenities you would expect for a Four Seasons hotel, and also has a twice-daily turn-down service.

For the ultimate in seclusion and glamour, the luxury beachside bungalows are a must-see, bringing the golden age of the Athens Riviera into the modern era.

With the press of a button, we were treated to glorious sunshine and deep blue-green ocean views, making every morning a true delight.
