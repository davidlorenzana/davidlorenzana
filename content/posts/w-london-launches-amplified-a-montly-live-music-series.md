This February, W London unveils AMPLIFIED, an electrifying monthly live music series at The Perception Bar, located inside the iconic hotel in the heart of Soho’s Leicester Square. Curated by DJ and W Music Curator Juss Jak (Jakki Degg), the series celebrates emerging talent from both local and international music scenes. Blending an exclusive music experience with a sophisticated night out, AMPLIFIED offers an intimate setting where guests can enjoy diverse genres like electronic, alt-pop, R&B, and indie, accompanied by bespoke cocktails and a vibrant atmosphere.

W AMPLIFIED will launch with headline performance by TMPLE.

The series launches on Friday 7 February 2025, with a headline performance by TMPLE, the London-based electronic duo known for their deep, melodic soundscapes and collaborations with industry legends such as Pete Tong and Damian Lazarus. Supporting TMPLE will be Juss Jak, whose signature deep house sets have made her a regular at world-renowned venues like Ibiza’s Space Terrace. March’s line-up features Belgian-born multi-instrumentalist Ciinderella Balthazar, showcasing her unique fusion of alt-pop, soul, and indie, alongside supporting acts Sophia Harari and Juss Jak. With additional acts and dates to be announced, AMPLIFIED promises a dynamic and ever-evolving programme.

Tickets for AMPLIFIED are available on the DICE platform, starting at just £6. W London’s latest initiative reflects the hotel’s dedication to championing emerging artists while delivering immersive music experiences in line with the global W Hotels brand.
