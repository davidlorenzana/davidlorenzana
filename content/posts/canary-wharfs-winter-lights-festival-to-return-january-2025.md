The Clew by Ottotto

Canary Wharf’s Winter Lights festival returns this January for its ninth edition, bringing with it a blend of light-based art installations from both renowned and emerging artists worldwide. The free, annual event has become a much-anticipated fixture for Londoners and visitors alike, as the neighbourhood is transformed into a vibrant, luminous wonderland. This year’s showcase includes 11 newly commissioned installations as well as popular permanent pieces.

Portal Lucid Creates

Among the highlights for 2025 are installations that blend realism with fantasy, including a stack of illuminated bathtubs created by Benedikt Tolar, which pulses with light and sound. At Cabot Square, Atelier Sisu’s *Evanescent Droplets* transforms the fountain into a mesmerising sparkling pool, while a UK-first display of a luminous bird in flight by Luminariste brings an ethereal energy to the space. Lucid Creates will present a larger-than-life light portal in Wood Wharf, inviting attendees into an almost otherworldly landscape that reflects the festival’s blend of immersive, experiential art.

The installations are open to explore nightly from 5 to 10 pm. For easy navigation, the Winter Lights map is available on Canary Wharf’s app.
