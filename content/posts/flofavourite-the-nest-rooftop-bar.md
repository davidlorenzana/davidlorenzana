The Nest is a welcome addition to London’s plethora of rooftop bars and is located just a short walk from Oxford Circus station. The bar sits on the 16th floor of the Treehouse Hotel which opened just under a year ago. It’s a quirky, green haven filled with wooden furniture and a wraparound terrace, offering 360-degree views of the city.

Whilst the food menu isn't particularly extensive, think small plates and light snacks, they do have a great selection of cocktails to make up for it. But if you in the mood for something more substantial then the hotel's main restaurant Madera is located just one floor below (15th floor) and also offers a similarly fantastic view of London. The restaurant serves a selection of Mexican cuisine and has several vegan-friendly dishes.

The Treehouse Hotel was founded by the 1 Hotels brand. The US-based company focuses on sustainable and eco-friendly hotels and has added London to its roster, with their other locations in New York, Miami and LA.
