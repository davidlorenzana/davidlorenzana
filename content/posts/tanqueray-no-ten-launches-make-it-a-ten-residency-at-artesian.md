Stanley Tucci and head bartender Giulia Cuccurullo present a curated cocktail experience at Artesian, in celebration of London Cocktail Week from 3 - 31 October 2024.

In celebration of London Cocktail Week, Tanqueray No. TEN has launched its ‘Make It a TEN’ residency at the renowned Artesian bar in The Langham Hotel. This collaboration highlights the artistry of both Tanqueray No. TEN and Artesian, known for its innovative mixology and exceptional flavours.

Actor and cocktail enthusiast Stanley Tucci has joined forces with Artesian’s head bartender, Giulia Cuccurullo, to create a menu inspired by the unique citrus heart of Tanqueray No. TEN. The selection features creative twists on classic cocktails like the Gimlet, French Martini, and French 75. The Gimlet balances sweet and sour, reminiscent of Italian summers, while the French 75 introduces an aromatic twist with jasmine tea. Each cocktail is paired with exquisite canapés, such as seared tuna with hoisin sauce and a vegan cucumber and pear tartlet.
