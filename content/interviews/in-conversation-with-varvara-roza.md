Varvara Roza.

Working from core values of trust and commitment, Varvara Roza is an increasingly renowned private art advisor and artist representative on the London scene whose verve and passion for bringing leading contemporary artists to the global stage is second to none. Originally haling from Greece, the London-based professional specialises in the promotion of contemporary art by established and emerging international artists, and represents a roster of truly exceptional trans generational talent, such as the septuagenarian British abstract artist Winston Branch (OBE), the brilliant Greek artist Manolis Anastasakos, and, more recently, the mystical American painter and sculptor Angelbert Metoyer. Dedicated in the pursuit of supporting rare talent and elevating the collections of her client base, she works personally with artists, collectors and art institutions and galleries, and is globally respected for her skill in sourcing unique masterpieces directly from source. Here, the imitable art-enthusiast shares the secrets of her unique approach to the art market, and tells us why integrity, transparency and accountability are the key attributes one must master to successfully navigate the art world.

**What would you say drives your passion as an art advisor and agent?**

Well, I am genuinely committed to the promotion of artists whose work is utterly integral to the landscape of contemporary art, because art, to me, is so much more than an asset class, and we must never allow the market undermine its true value – shining light in a world that feels increasingly dark and fractured. There are many opportunists in the business of contemporary art, but art is not simply something to be flipped or burned for fast profit. It is about the elevation of the human spirit, above all else, and I only work with international artists whose work explores what it means to be human in a fast-changing world. Promoting an artist and enabling them to enter prestigious institutions is not something I need to do; it is something I want to do. There is a spiritual dimension to great art, and I think because that underpins my key criteria in terms of representation, the established and emerging international artists I represent tend to span myriad disciplines.

**What would you say makes you different from other art advisors and managers?**

I believe very much in the importance of the personal relationship, and, for me, trust and empathy are the cornerstone of any relationship, business or otherwise. Art is deeply personal by its very nature, and the most important element in art investment is that it is built upon individual taste backed by knowledge. I never operate in an impersonal way, and I always stress to my clients the importance of taking the long view in terms of investment in art, and buying only the works that they love. It's so important for me to share an honest, realistic and philosophical approach to art investment that guarantees results, rather than speculating purely on the basis of perceived profit margins. I am also very discreet when resourcing artworks for private clients – I want to help all of my clientele build collections that will stand the test of time and slowly accrue genuine value.

**You are originally from Greece but have long been based in London, why is London home for your business?**

London, for me, is the absolute epicentre of the art world, and it is a place where so many different cultures coalesce in incredible ways – I suppose, in a sense, it is not unlike ancient Athens, where so many different cultures have converged throughout history. It’s a constantly exciting environment, and it’s one of the greatest cities in the world for doing business in the art world. I have built my reputation in London, and I have always felt that the most important thing you can build in terms of representing artists, and dealing with everything from private clients to auction houses is trust, because, like much of life, your reputation is your greatest asset, and you must never lose sight of doing the right thing. I am based in London, but I work with several leading museums, collectors and institutions globally in acquisitions of strategic artworks, and transparency and integrity are absolutely key in managing those relationships.

**You have a number of shows later this year, and the launch of the Varvara Roza agency this month – can you talk to us about the ethos behind that?**

Well, the agency is kind of the next step and a natural evolution for me. We will be hosting a number of exhibitions this year with a focus on trans generational artists whose work spins upon the axis of creativity and human experience. For me, it is all about putting on shows that invite the activation of wonder. One of my great passions when I talk publicly about art investment is to foster discussions about the meaning and impact of art and its implications for our lives. Winston Branch is one artist I represent that I love in that regard. His abstract works unfold like visual poetry and contain a spontaneity that is so utterly human and alive. They are just such incredibly exciting paintings, and he is an artist who has made a vital contribution towards the canon of contemporary art. His singular mastery of the colour spectrum is a lifelong obsession for him, and it’s that kind of obsession that attracts me to an artist.

**Are there any new artists you are working with that you are particularly excited about at the moment?**

Well, there are so many wonderful artists, and I cannot choose any above others. There are lots of things going on at the moment with the curator Vassiliki Tzankou coming on board, and an exciting new project that I need to keep under wraps for now. We have shows coming up with the British painter and author Tom de Freston, whose body of work presents visions of humanity that unearth a strange beauty, and the Norwegian-Egyptian abstract expressionist Britt Boutros Ghali, whose work I adore. What I seek in all of the artists I work with is a truly provocative imagination that has the wherewithal to take on subjects that are sometimes difficult, but also essential, and, to me, that is a measure of the true value of the artist – their ability to communicate these eternal paradoxes in humanity. And, if you are going to be all about the true value of art as a dealer and gallerist, then that is where the trust in you will come from – because, as I have said many times in the past, you cannot exist in the art world without trust. When I advise a client that a piece of art will accrue in value, I know this will be true because I do my homework, and I know the quality of the work, and the vital nature of what it is communicating, is priceless.
